| Proprietary features                                | Bad, non-free features by EE edition    | Good, everything is free and opensource      |
| Resource locking                                    | No, parallel builds could hang registry | Yes, e.g. could lock Docker registry         |

| Vulnerability reports                               | Yes, but only in the changelog          | Yes, per instance                            |
| Configuration as a code                             | No                                      | Yes, as a YAML via JCASC                     |

Quite period is a protection for commiters.  E.g. you could stop a pipeline
before a timeout exceeds.  Or you could merge a lot of branches to master (or
main) branch, and do not trigger master (or main) branch several times.
