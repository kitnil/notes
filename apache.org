* Syntax

If you are using Apache 2.4 and above, you might get the following error message. This might specifically start happening after you’ve upgraded from an older version of apache.
: AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /home/myapp/server/

  - Remove any “Order deny,allow”, “Order allow,deny”, and related lines
  - Replace “Deny from all” to “Require all denied”
  - Replace “Allow from all” to “Require all granted”
  - If you are allowing any specific hostname, change them accordingly. For example, replace “Allow from 192.168.1.2” to “Require host 192.168.1.2”
