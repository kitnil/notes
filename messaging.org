Hi Guixers!

Since this has bitten me for a long time and it seems to trip many
IceCat users, I'd like to share a tip to get https://meet.jit.si/ to
work on IceCat:

- Install a user agent switcher extension like this one:
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/

- Switch to the latest Firefox user agent.  Make sure to apply the
  change to the right tab.

By the way, this seems to fix more than just Jitsi.
