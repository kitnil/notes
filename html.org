How to insert image in HTML as a binary?

27/04/2023, 12:17:20

In HTML, you can insert an image as a binary by using the "data" URI
scheme. This scheme allows you to include the image data directly in the
document as a base64-encoded string.

Here's an example of how to use it:

html

<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD...">

In this example, the image data is encoded in base64 and included directly
after the "base64," substring of the URL. The "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD..."
portion of the URL is the actual image data in base64.

You would replace this with your own base64-encoded image data. Note that this
method can result in larger page sizes and slower loading times, so it's
generally not recommended for large images or pages with multiple images.
