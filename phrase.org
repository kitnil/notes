You could start with https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Contributing.html
People usually start with a packaging though, e.g. as you mentioned a Boehm garbage collector would be great to have in Guix package collection 
Also, if people cannot answer here, you could ask more folks on help and devel mailing lists, see https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/contact/

Could you run ‘guix lint’ on this package and address any issues it
reports?

‘git-fetch’ to retrieve software from GitHub.  Could you make this
change?

Could you try adding a phase that sets the “HOME” environment variable
right before the ‘check’ phase?  See for example ‘python-biopython’ on
how to do it.

Source file headers contain the “or any later version” wording so it
should be ‘license:gpl2+’.
