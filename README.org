* Introduction
A *complex number* is a [[number]] that can be expressed in the form $a + bi$, where:
- $a$ and $b$ are [[real_number][real numbers]];
- $i$ is the imaginary unit, that satisfies the equation $i^{2} = -1$.

In this expression:
- $a$ is the [[real part]];
- $b$ is the the [[imaginary part]] of complex number.

Complex numbers extend the concept of
the [[one-dimensional]] [[number_line][number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex_plane][complex plane]] by using:
- the horizontal axis for the real part;
- the vertical axis for the imaginary part.

The complex number $a + bi$ can be identified with the point $(a, b)$ in the complex plane.

A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary_number][imaginary]].
Whereas a complex number whose imaginary part is zero is a real number.

In this way, the complex numbers [[Field_extension][contain]] the ordinary real numbers
while extending them in order to solve problems that cannot be solved with real numbers alone.

As well as their use within mathematics, complex numbers have practical
applications in many fields, including:
- [[physics]]
- [[chemistry]]
- [[biology]]
- [[economics]]
- [[electrical_engineering][electrical engineering]]
- [[statistics]]

The Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo_Cardano][Gerolamo Cardano]] is the first known to have introduced complex numbers.
He called them "fictitious" during his attempts to find solutions to [[cubic_equations][cubic equations]] in the 16th century.

* TODO Overview

Complex numbers allow solutions to certain equations that have no solutions in [[real_numbers][real numbers]].

For example, the equation $$(x+1)^2 = -9 \,$$ has no real solution,
since the square of a real number cannot be negative.

Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem.

The idea is to [[field_extension][extend]] the real numbers with the [[imaginary_unit][imaginary unit]] $i$ where $i^{2} = -1$,
so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found.

In this case the solutions are $-1 +3i$ and $-1 -3i$, as can be verified using the fact that $i^{2} = -1$:

$$((-1+3i)+1)^2 = (3i)^2 = (3^2)(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9,$$

$$((-1-3i)+1)^2 = (-3i)^2 = (-3)^2(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9.$$

According to [[the_fundamental_theorem_of_algebra][the fundamental theorem of algebra]],
all [[polynomial_equation][polynomial equations]] with real or complex coefficients in a single variable have a solution in complex numbers.

** TODO Definition

A complex number is a number of the form $a + bi$,
- $a$ and $b$ are real numbers
- $i$ is the /imaginary unit/, satisfying $i^{2} = -1$.

For example: $-3.5 + 2i$ is a complex number.

The real number $a$ is called the /real part/ of the complex number $a + bi$;
the real number $b$ is called the /imaginary part/ of $a + bi$.

By this convention the imaginary part does not include the imaginary unit:
hence $b$, not $bi$, is the imaginary part.

The real part of a complex number $z$ is denoted by $\operatorname{Re}(z)$ or $\Re\left(z\right)$;
the imaginary part of a complex number $z$ is denoted by $\operatorname{Im}(z)$ or $ℑ(z)$.

For example:
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{Re}(-3.5 + 2i) &= -3.5 \\
  \operatorname{Im}(-3.5 + 2i) &= 2.
\end{align}

Hence, in terms of its real and imaginary parts,
a complex number is equal to $\operatorname{Re}(z) + \operatorname{Im}(z) \cdot i$.
This expression is sometimes known as the Cartesian form of $z$.

A real number can be regarded as a complex number whose imaginary part is 0.

A purely [[imaginary_number][imaginary number]] is a complex number whose real part is zero.

It is common to write for $a$ and for $a + 0i$ and $bi$ for $0 + bi$.

Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative,
it is common to write $a -bi$ with $b > 0$ instead of $a + (-b)i$.

For example $3 -4i$ instead of $3 +(-4i)$.

The [[Set_(mathematics)][set]] of all complex numbers is denoted by: $mathℂ$ or $\mathbf{C}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

** Notation

Some authors write instead of , particularly when /b/ is a radical.
In some disciplines, in particular [[electromagnetism]] and
[[electrical_engineering][electrical engineering]], is used instead of
, [6] since is frequently used for [[electric_current][electric
current]]. In these cases complex numbers are written as or .

** Complex plane

[[A plus bi.svg]] A complex number can be viewed as a point or
[[Vector_(geometric)][position vector]] in a two-dimensional
[[Cartesian_coordinate_system][Cartesian coordinate system]] called the
complex plane or [[Argand_diagram][Argand diagram]] (see and ), named
after [[Jean-Robert_Argand][Jean-Robert Argand]]. The numbers are
conventionally plotted using the real part as the horizontal component,
and imaginary part as vertical (see Figure 1). These two values used to
identify a given complex number are therefore called its /Cartesian/,
/rectangular/, or /algebraic form/.

A position vector may also be defined in terms of its magnitude and
direction relative to the origin. These are emphasized in a complex
number's /[[#Polar_form][polar form]]/. Using the polar form of the
complex number in calculations may lead to a more intuitive
interpretation of mathematical results. Notably, the operations of
addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character
when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition
corresponds to [[Euclidean_vector#Addition_and_subtraction][vector
addition]] while multiplication corresponds to multiplying their
magnitudes and adding their arguments (i.e. the angles they make with
the /x/ axis). Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number
by corresponds to rotating the position vector
[[orientation_(geometry)][counterclockwise]] by a quarter
[[turn_(geometry)][turn]] ([[right_angle][90°]]) about the origin: =
^{2} = .

** History in brief

-   :: /Main section: [[#History][History]]/

The solution in radicals (without
[[trigonometric_functions][trigonometric functions]]) of a general cubic
equation contains the square roots of [[negative_numbers][negative
numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot
be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational_root_test][rational
root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible_polynomial][irreducible]] (the
so-called [[casus_irreducibilis][casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum
led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo_Cardano][Gerolamo Cardano]] to
conceive of complex numbers in around 1545, though his understanding was
rudimentary.

Work on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the
[[fundamental_theorem_of_algebra][fundamental theorem of algebra]],
which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every
[[polynomial]] equation of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus
form an [[algebraically_closed_field][algebraically closed field]],
where any [[polynomial]] equation has a [[Root_of_a_function][root]].

Many mathematicians contributed to the full development of complex
numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician
[[Rafael_Bombelli][Rafael Bombelli]]. [7] A more abstract formalism for
the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician
[[William_Rowan_Hamilton][William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this
abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].

* Relations

** Equality

Two complex numbers are equal [[iff][if and only if]] both their real
and imaginary parts are equal. In symbols:

$$z_{1} = z_{2} \, \, \leftrightarrow \, \, ( \operatorname{Re}(z_{1}) = \operatorname{Re}(z_{2}) \, \and \, \operatorname{Im} (z_{1}) = \operatorname{Im} (z_{2})).$$

** Ordering

Because complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a
two-dimensional plane, there is no natural [[linear_ordering][linear
ordering]] on the set of complex numbers. [8]

There is no [[linear_ordering][linear ordering]] on the complex numbers
that is compatible with addition and multiplication. Formally, we say
that the complex numbers cannot have the structure of an
[[ordered_field][ordered field]]. This is because any square in an
ordered field is at least , but .

* Elementary operations

** Conjugate

[[Complex conjugate picture.svg]] The /[[complex_conjugate][complex
conjugate]]/ of the complex number is defined to be . It is denoted by
either $\bar{z}$ or .

Formally, for any complex number /z/:

$$\bar{z} = \operatorname{Re}(z) - \operatorname{Im}(z) \cdot i .$$

Geometrically, $\bar{z}$ is the [[reflection_symmetry]["reflection"]] of
about the real axis. Conjugating twice gives the original complex
number: $\bar{\bar{z}}=z$.

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be extracted using
the conjugate:

-   :: $\operatorname{Re}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2}(z+\bar{z}), \,$
   $\operatorname{Im}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2i}(z-\bar{z}). \,$

Moreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its
conjugate.

Conjugation distributes over the standard arithmetic operations:

-   :: $\overline{z+w} = \bar{z} + \bar{w}, \,$
   $\overline{z-w} = \bar{z} - \bar{w}, \,$
   $\overline{z w} = \bar{z} \bar{w}, \,$
   $\overline{(z/w)} = \bar{z}/\bar{w}. \,$

** Addition and subtraction

[[Vector Addition.svg]] Complex numbers are [[addition][added]] by
separately adding the real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is
to say:

$$(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i.\$$ Similarly, [[subtraction]] is
defined by

$$(a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i.\$$ Using the visualization of
complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following
geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers /A/ and /B/,
interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point /X/ obtained by
building a [[parallelogram]], three of whose vertices are /O/, /A/ and
/B/. Equivalently, /X/ is the point such that the
[[triangle][triangles]] with vertices /O/, /A/, /B/, and /X/, /B/, /A/,
are [[Congruence_(geometry)][congruent]].

** Multiplication and division

The multiplication of two complex numbers is defined by the following
formula:

$$(a+bi) (c+di) = (ac-bd) + (bc+ad)i.\$$ In particular, the
[[square_(algebra)][square]] of the imaginary unit is −1:

$$i^2 = i \times i = -1.\$$

The preceding definition of multiplication of general complex numbers
follows naturally from this fundamental property of the imaginary unit.
Indeed, if is treated as a number so that means times , the above
multiplication rule is identical to the usual rule for multiplying two
sums of two terms.

$$(a+bi) (c+di) = ac + bci + adi + bidi$$ ([[distributive_property][distributive
property]])

-   :: -   :: $= ac + bidi + bci + adi$ ([[commutative_property][commutative
      property]] of addition---the order of the summands can be changed)
      $= ac + bdi^2 + (bc+ad)i$ (commutative and distributive
      properties)
      $= (ac-bd) + (bc+ad)i$ (fundamental property of the imaginary
      unit).

The division of two complex numbers is defined in terms of complex
multiplication, which is described above, and real division. When at
least one of and is non-zero, we have

$$\,\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + \left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right)i.$$
Division can be defined in this way because of the following
observation:

$$\,\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{\left(a + bi\right) \cdot \left(c - di\right)}{\left (c + di\right) \cdot \left (c - di\right)} = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + \left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right)i.$$
As shown earlier, is the complex conjugate of the denominator . At least
one of the real part and the imaginary part of the [[denominator]] must
be nonzero for division to be defined. This is called
"[[rationalisation_(mathematics)][rationalization]]" of the denominator
(although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational
real number).

** Reciprocal

The [[Multiplicative_inverse][reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number
is given by

-   :: $\frac{1}{z}=\frac{\bar{z}}{z \bar{z}}=\frac{\bar{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i.$

This formula can be used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a
complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates.
[[Inversive_geometry][Inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry
studying reflections more general than ones about a line, can also be
expressed in terms of complex numbers. In the
[[Network_analysis_(electrical_circuits)][network analysis of electrical
circuits]], the complex conjugate is used in finding the equivalent
impedance when the [[maximum_power_transfer_theorem][maximum power
transfer theorem]] is used.

** Square root

The square roots of (with ) are $\pm (\gamma + \delta i)$, where

$$\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}$$

and

$$\delta = \sgn (b) \sqrt{\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},$$

where sgn is the [[sign_function][signum]] function. This can be seen by
squaring $\pm (\gamma + \delta i)$ to obtain . [9] [10] Here
$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ is called the [[absolute_value][modulus]] of , and
the square root sign indicates the square root with non-negative real
part, called the *principal square root*; also
$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}= \sqrt{z\bar{z}}$, where $z = a + bi$. [11]

* Polar form

#+CAPTION: Figure 2: The argument and modulus locate a point on an
Argand diagram; $r(\cos \varphi + i \sin \varphi)$ or $r e^{i\varphi}$
are /polar/ expressions of the point.

[[Complex number illustration modarg.svg]]
** Absolute value and argument

An alternative way of defining a point /P/ in the complex plane, other
than using the /x/- and /y/-coordinates, is to use the distance of the
point from /O/, the point whose coordinates are (the
[[origin_(mathematics)][origin]]), together with the angle subtended
between the [[positive_real_axis][positive real axis]] and the line
segment /OP/ in a counterclockwise direction. This idea leads to the
polar form of complex numbers.

The /[[absolute_value][absolute value]]/ (or /modulus/ or /magnitude/)
of a complex number is

$$\textstyle r=|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\,$$ If is a real number (i.e., ),
then  /x/ {{!}}}}. In general, by [[Pythagoras'_theorem][Pythagoras'
theorem]], is the distance of the point /P/ representing the complex
number to the origin. The square of the absolute value is

$$\textstyle |z|^2=z\bar{z}=x^2+y^2.\,$$ where $\bar{z}$ is the
[[#Conjugation][complex conjugate]] of $z$.

The /[[arg_(mathematics)][argument]]/ of (in many applications referred
to as the "phase") is the angle of the [[radius]] /OP/ with the positive
real axis, and is written as $\arg(z)$. As with the modulus, the
argument can be found from the rectangular form $x+yi$: [12]

$$\varphi = \arg(z) =
\begin{cases}
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) & \mbox{if } x > 0 \\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) + \pi & \mbox{if } x < 0 \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\arctan(\frac{y}{x}) - \pi & \mbox{if } x < 0 \mbox{ and } y < 0\\
\frac{\pi}{2} & \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y > 0\\
-\frac{\pi}{2} & \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y < 0\\
\mbox{indeterminate } & \mbox{if } x = 0 \mbox{ and } y = 0.
\end{cases}$$

Normally, as given above, the [[principal_value][principal value]] in
the interval is chosen. Values in the range are obtained by adding if
the value is negative. The value of is expressed in [[radian][radians]]
in this article. It can increase by any integer multiple of and still
give the same angle. Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as
[[Multivalued_function][multivalued]]. The polar angle for the complex
number 0 is indeterminate, but arbitrary choice of the angle 0 is
common.

The value of equals the result of [[atan2]]:
$\varphi = \mbox{atan2}(\mbox{imaginary}, \mbox{real})$.

Together, and give another way of representing complex numbers, the
/polar form/, as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify
the position of a point on the plane. Recovering the original
rectangular co-ordinates from the polar form is done by the formula
called /trigonometric form/

$$z = r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ).\,$$

Using [[Euler's_formula][Euler's formula]] this can be written as

$$z = r e^{i \varphi}.\,$$

Using the [[Cis_(mathematics)][cis]] function, this is sometimes
abbreviated to

$$z = r \operatorname{cis} \varphi. \,$$

In [[angle_notation][angle notation]], often used in [[electronics]] to
represent a [[Phasor_(sine_waves)][phasor]] with amplitude and phase ,
it is written as [13]

$$z = r \ang \varphi . \,$$

** Multiplication and division in polar form

[[Complex multi.svg]] Formulas for multiplication, division and
exponentiation are simpler in polar form than the corresponding formulas
in Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers and , because of the
well-known trigonometric identities

$$\cos(a)\cos(b) - \sin(a)\sin(b) = \cos(a + b)$$

$$\cos(a)\sin(b) + \sin(a)\cos(b) = \sin(a + b)$$

we may derive

$$z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\cos(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)).\,$$
In other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are
added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying
by corresponds to a quarter-[[turn_(geometry)][turn]] counter-clockwise,
which gives back . The picture at the right illustrates the
multiplication of

$$(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. \,$$ Since the real and imaginary part of are equal,
the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or π/4 (in [[radian]]). On
the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the
red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2),
respectively. Thus, the formula

$$\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{3}$$ holds. As
the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas
like this---known as [[Machin-like_formulas][Machin-like
formulas]]---are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi][π]].

Similarly, division is given by

$$\frac{z_1}{ z_2} = \frac{r_1}{ r_2} \left(\cos(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)\right).$$

* Exponentiation

** Euler's formula

[[Euler's_formula][Euler's formula]] states that, for any real number ,

-   :: $e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x \$,

where is the [[e_(mathematical_constant)][base of the natural
logarithm]]. This can be proved through induction by observing that

-   :: \begin{align}

i\^0 &{}= 1, \quad & i\^1 &{}= i, \quad & i\^2 &{}= -1, \quad & i\^3
&{}= -i, \\ i\^4 &={} 1, \quad & i\^5 &={} i, \quad & i\^6 &{}= -1,
\quad & i\^7 &{}= -i, \end{align}

and so on, and by considering the [[Taylor_series][Taylor series]]
expansions of , and :

-   :: \begin{align}

=e^{ix} &{}= 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \frac{(ix)^5}{5!} + \frac{(ix)^6}{6!} + \frac{(ix)^7}{7!} + \frac{(ix)^8}{8!} + \cdots \\[8pt]=\\
=       &{}= 1 + ix - \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{ix^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{ix^5}{5!} -\frac{x^6}{6!} - \frac{ix^7}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \cdots \\[8pt]=\\
=       &{}= \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} - \cdots \right) + i\left( x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) \\[8pt]=\\
=       &{}= \cos x + i\sin x \ .=

\end{align}

The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is
[[absolute_convergence][absolutely convergent]].

** Natural logarithm

Euler's formula allows us to observe that, for any complex number

$$z = r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ).\,$$

where /r/ is a non-negative real number, one possible value for /z/'s
[[natural_logarithm][natural logarithm]] is

$$\ln (z)= \ln(r) + \varphi i$$

Because cos and sin are periodic functions, the natural logarithm may be
considered a multi-valued function, with:

$$\ln(z) = \left\{ \ln(r) + (\varphi + 2\pi k)i \;|\; k \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$

** Integer and fractional exponents

We may use the identity

$$\ln(a^{b}) = b \ln(a)$$

to define complex exponentiation, which is likewise multi-valued:

$$\ln (z^n)=\ln((r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ))^{n})$$

$$= n \ln(r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi))$$

$$= \{ n (\ln(r) + (\varphi + k2\pi) i) | k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$

$$= \{ n \ln(r) + n \varphi i + nk2\pi i | k \in \mathbb{Z} \}.$$

When /n/ is an integer, this simplifies to [[de_Moivre's_formula][de
Moivre's formula]]:

$$z^{n}=(r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ))^{n} = r^n\,(\cos n\varphi + i \sin n \varphi).$$

The th [[Nth_root][roots]] of are given by

$$\sqrt[n]{z} = \sqrt[n]r \left( \cos \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right)\right)$$
for any integer satisfying . Here is the usual (positive) th root of the
positive real number . While the th root of a positive real number is
chosen to be the /positive/ real number satisfying there is no natural
way of distinguishing one particular complex th root of a complex
number. Therefore, the th root of is considered as a
[[multivalued_function][multivalued function]] (in ), as opposed to a
usual function , for which is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such
as

$$\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z$$ (which holds for positive real numbers), do in
general not hold for complex numbers.

* Properties

** Field structure

The set *C* of complex numbers is a [[field_(mathematics)][field]].
Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two
complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex
number. Second, for any complex number , its
[[additive_inverse][additive inverse]] is also a complex number; and
third, every nonzero complex number has a
[[Multiplicative_inverse][reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these
operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of
[[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex
numbers and :

$$z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,$$

$$z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.$$ These two laws and the other requirements on a
field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the
real numbers themselves form a field.

Unlike the reals, *C* is not an [[ordered_field][ordered field]], that
is to say, it is not possible to define a relation that is compatible
with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the
square of any element is necessarily positive, so precludes the
existence of an [[total_order][ordering]] on *C*.

When the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the
field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to
reflect that fact. For example: [[complex_analysis][complex analysis]],
complex [[matrix_(mathematics)][matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and
complex [[Lie_algebra][Lie algebra]].

** Solutions of polynomial equations

Given any complex numbers (called [[coefficient][coefficients]]) , the
equation

$$a_n z^n + \dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0$$ has at least one complex solution
/z/, provided that at least one of the higher coefficients is nonzero.
This is the statement of the
/[[fundamental_theorem_of_algebra][fundamental theorem of algebra]]/.
Because of this fact, *C* is called an
[[algebraically_closed_field][algebraically closed field]]. This
property does not hold for the [[rational_number][field of rational
numbers]] *Q* (the polynomial does not have a rational root, since
[[square_root_of_2][]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers
*R* (the polynomial does not have a real root for , since the square of
is positive for any real number ).

There are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods
such as [[Liouville's_theorem_(complex_analysis)][Liouville's theorem]],
or [[topology][topological]] ones such as the [[winding_number][winding
number]], or a proof combining [[Galois_theory][Galois theory]] and the
fact that any real polynomial of /odd/ degree has at least one real
root.

Because of this fact, theorems that hold /for any algebraically closed
field/, apply to *C*. For example, any non-empty complex
[[square_matrix][square matrix]] has at least one (complex)
[[eigenvalue]].

** Algebraic characterization

The field *C* has the following three properties: first, it has
[[characteristic_(algebra)][characteristic]] 0. This means that for any
number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its
[[transcendence_degree][transcendence degree]] over *Q*, the
[[prime_field][prime field]] of *C*, is the
[[cardinality_of_the_continuum][cardinality of the continuum]]. Third,
it is [[algebraically_closed][algebraically closed]] (see above). It can
be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a
field) to *C*. For example, the [[algebraic_closure][algebraic closure]]
of [[p-adic_numbers][*Q*_{/p/}]] also satisfies these three properties,
so these two fields are isomorphic. Also, *C* is isomorphic to the field
of complex [[Puiseux_series][Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an
isomorphism requires the [[axiom_of_choice][axiom of choice]]. Another
consequence of this algebraic characterization is that *C* contains many
proper subfields that are isomorphic to *C*.

** Characterization as a topological field

The preceding characterization of *C* describes only the algebraic
aspects of *C*. That is to say, the properties of
[[neighborhood_(topology)][nearness]] and
[[continuity_(topology)][continuity]], which matter in areas such as
[[Mathematical_analysis][analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt
with. The following description of *C* as a
[[topological_ring][topological field]] (that is, a field that is
equipped with a [[topological_space][topology]], which allows the notion
of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. *C*
contains a subset (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero
elements satisfying the following three conditions:

-  is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.

-  If and are distinct elements of , then either or is in .
-  If is any nonempty subset of , then for some in *C*.

Moreover, *C* has a nontrivial [[involution_(mathematics)][involutive]]
[[automorphism]] (namely the complex conjugation), such that is in for
any nonzero in *C*.

Any field with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking
the sets /p/ − (/y/ − /x/)(/y/ − /x/)* ∈ /P/ } }} as a
[[base_(topology)][base]], where ranges over the field and ranges over .
With this topology is isomorphic as a /topological/ field to *C*.

The only [[connected_space][connected]] [[locally_compact][locally
compact]] [[topological_ring][topological fields]] are *R* and *C*. This
gives another characterization of *C* as a topological field, since *C*
can be distinguished from *R* because the nonzero complex numbers are
[[connected_space][connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.

* Formal construction

** Formal development

Above, complex numbers have been defined by introducing , the imaginary
unit, as a symbol. More rigorously, the set of complex numbers can be
defined as the set of [[ordered_pairs][ordered pairs]] of real numbers.
In this notation, the above formulas for addition and multiplication
read

-   :: \begin{align}

(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\ (a, b) \cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc
+ ad). \end{align}

It is then just a matter of notation to express as .

Though this low-level construction does accurately describe the
structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition
reveals the algebraic nature of more immediately. This characterization
relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed
with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that
behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the
[[distributive_law][distributive law]]

$$(x+y) z = xz + yz$$ must hold for any three elements , and of a field.
The set of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial with real
[[coefficient][coefficients]] is an expression of the form

$$a_nX^n+\dotsb+a_1X+a_0$$, where the are real numbers. The usual
addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set of all such
polynomials with a [[ring_(mathematics)][ring]] structure. This ring is
called [[polynomial_ring][polynomial ring]].

The [[quotient_ring][quotient ring]] can be shown to be a field. This
extension field contains two square roots of , namely (the
[[coset][cosets]] of) and , respectively. (The cosets of) and form a
basis of as a real [[vector_space][vector space]], which means that each
element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a
[[linear_combination][linear combination]] in these two elements.
Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered
pairs of real numbers. Moreover, the above formulas for addition etc.
correspond to the ones yielded by this [[abstract_algebra][abstract
algebraic]] approach---the two definitions of the field are said to be
[[isomorphism][isomorphic]] (as fields). Together with the
above-mentioned fact that is algebraically closed, this also shows that
is an [[algebraic_closure][algebraic closure]] of .

** Matrix representation of complex numbers

Complex numbers can also be represented by
[[matrix_(mathematics)][matrices]] that have the following form:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
  a &   -b  \\
  b & \;\; a
\end{pmatrix}.$$ Here the entries and are real numbers. The sum and
product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and
product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and
[[matrix_multiplication][product]] of such matrices. The geometric
description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be
expressed in terms of [[rotation_matrix][rotation matrices]] by using
this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover,
the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a
matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:

$$|z|^2 =
\begin{vmatrix}
  a & -b  \\
  b &  a
\end{vmatrix}
= (a^2) - ((-b)(b)) = a^2 + b^2.$$ The conjugate $\overline z$
corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.

Though this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most
common, many other representations arise from matrices /other than/
$\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$ that
square to the negative of the [[identity_matrix][identity matrix]]. See
the article on [[2_×_2_real_matrices][2 × 2 real matrices]] for other
representations of complex numbers.

* Complex analysis

[[Sin1perz.png]]

The study of functions of a complex variable is known as
[[complex_analysis][complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in
[[applied_mathematics][applied mathematics]] as well as in other
branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements
in [[real_analysis][real analysis]] or even [[number_theory][number
theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see
[[prime_number_theorem][prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike
real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional
graphs, [[complex_function][complex functions]] have four-dimensional
graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a
[[three-dimensional_graph][three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four
dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic
transformation of the complex plane.

** Complex exponential and related functions

The notions of [[convergent_series][convergent series]] and
[[continuous_function][continuous functions]] in (real) analysis have
natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence of complex numbers is
said to [[convergent_sequence][converge]] if and only if its real and
imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the
[[(ε,_δ)-definition_of_limit][(ε, δ)-definition of limits]], where the
absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex
numbers. From a more abstract point of view, *C*, endowed with the
[[metric_(mathematics)][metric]]

$$\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2| \,$$ is a complete
[[metric_space][metric space]], which notably includes the
[[triangle_inequality][triangle inequality]]

$$|z_1 + z_2| \le |z_1| + |z_2|$$ for any two complex numbers and .

Like in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a
number of [[elementary_function][elementary functions]]: the
/[[exponential_function][exponential function]]/ , also written , is
defined as the [[infinite_series][infinite series]]

$$\exp(z):= 1+z+\frac{z^2}{2\cdot 1}+\frac{z^3}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1}+\cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{n!}. \,$$
and the series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and
[[cosine]], as well as [[hyperbolic_functions][hyperbolic functions]]
such as [[sinh]] also carry over to complex arguments without change.
/[[Euler's_identity][Euler's identity]]/ states:

$$\exp(i\varphi) = \cos(\varphi) + i\sin(\varphi) \,$$ for any real
number /φ/, in particular

$$\exp(i \pi) = -1 \,$$ Unlike in the situation of real numbers, there
is an [[infinite_set][infinitude]] of complex solutions of the equation

$$\exp(z) = w \,$$ for any complex number . It can be shown that any
such solution ---called [[complex_logarithm][complex logarithm]] of
---satisfies

$$\log(x+iy)=\ln|w| + i\arg(w), \,$$ where arg is the
[[arg_(mathematics)][argument]] defined [[#Polar_form][above]], and ln
the (real) [[natural_logarithm][natural logarithm]]. As arg is a
[[multivalued_function][multivalued function]], unique only up to a
multiple of 2/π/, log is also multivalued. The
[[principal_value][principal value]] of log is often taken by
restricting the imaginary part to the
[[interval_(mathematics)][interval]] .

Complex [[exponentiation]] is defined as

$$z^\omega = \exp(\omega \log z). \,$$ Consequently, they are in general
multi-valued. For , for some natural number , this recovers the
non-uniqueness of th roots mentioned above.

Complex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the
unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when naïvely
treated as single-valued functions; see
[[Exponentiation#Failure_of_power_and_logarithm_identities][failure of
power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy

$$\,a^{bc} = (a^b)^c.$$ Both sides of the equation are multivalued by
the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on
the left are a subset of those on the right.

** Holomorphic functions

A function /f/ : *C* → *C* is called
[[Holomorphic_function][holomorphic]] if it satisfies the
[[Cauchy–Riemann_equations][Cauchy--Riemann equations]]. For example,
any
[[Linear_transformation#Definition_and_first_consequences][*R*-linear]]
map *C* → *C* can be written in the form

$$f(z)=az+b\overline{z}$$ with complex coefficients and . This map is
holomorphic [[if_and_only_if][if and only if]] . The second summand
$b \overline z$ is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the
[[Cauchy–Riemann_equations][Cauchy--Riemann equations]].

Complex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For
example, any two holomorphic functions and that agree on an arbitrarily
small [[open_subset][open subset]] of *C* necessarily agree everywhere.
[[Meromorphic_function][Meromorphic functions]], functions that can
locally be written as with a holomorphic function , still share some of
the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have
[[essential_singularity][essential singularities]], such as at .

* Applications

Complex numbers have essential concrete applications in a variety of
scientific and related areas such as [[signal_processing][signal
processing]], [[control_theory][control theory]], [[electromagnetism]],
[[fluid_dynamics][fluid dynamics]], [[quantum_mechanics][quantum
mechanics]], [[cartography]], and
[[Vibration#Vibration_analysis][vibration analysis]]. Some applications
of complex numbers are:

** Control theory

In [[control_theory][control theory]], systems are often transformed
from the [[time_domain][time domain]] to the
[[frequency_domain][frequency domain]] using the
[[Laplace_transform][Laplace transform]]. The system's
[[pole_(complex_analysis)][poles]] and
[[zero_(complex_analysis)][zeros]] are then analyzed in the /complex
plane/. The [[root_locus][root locus]], [[Nyquist_plot][Nyquist plot]],
and [[Nichols_plot][Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the
complex plane.

In the root locus method, it is especially important whether the
[[pole_(complex_analysis)][poles]] and
[[zero_(complex_analysis)][zeros]] are in the left or right half planes,
i.e. have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear,
time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are

-  in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],
-  all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO_stability][stable]],
-  on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal_stability][marginal
   stability]].

If a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a
[[nonminimum_phase][nonminimum phase]] system.

** Improper integrals

In applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain
real-valued [[improper_integral][improper integrals]], by means of
complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see
[[methods_of_contour_integration][methods of contour integration]].

** Fluid dynamics

In [[fluid_dynamics][fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to
describe [[potential_flow_in_two_dimensions][potential flow in two
dimensions]].

** Dynamic equations

In [[differential_equations][differential equations]], it is common to
first find all complex roots of the
[[Linear_differential_equation#Homogeneous_equations_with_constant_coefficients][characteristic
equation]] of a [[linear_differential_equation][linear differential
equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in
terms of base functions of the form . Likewise, in
[[difference_equations][difference equations]], the complex roots of the
characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to
attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form .

** Electromagnetism and electrical engineering

In [[electrical_engineering][electrical engineering]], the
[[Fourier_transform][Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying
[[voltage][voltages]] and [[Electric_current][currents]]. The treatment
of [[resistor][resistors]], [[capacitor][capacitors]], and
[[inductor][inductors]] can then be unified by introducing imaginary,
frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all
three in a single complex number called the
[[Electrical_impedance][impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]]
calculus.

In electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by , to avoid
confusion with , which is generally in use to denote
[[electric_current][electric current]], or, more particularly, , which
is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.

Since the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric_circuit][circuit]] is
oscillating, it can be represented as

$$V(t) = V_0 e^{j \omega t} = V_0 \left (\cos \omega t + j \sin\omega t \right ),$$

To obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:

$$v(t) = \mathrm{Re}(V) = \mathrm{Re}\left [ V_0 e^{j \omega t} \right ] = V_0 \cos \omega t.$$

The complex-valued signal $V(t)$ is called the
[[analytic_signal][analytic]] representation of the real-valued,
measurable signal $v(t)$.  [14]

** Signal analysis

Complex numbers are used in [[signal_analysis][signal analysis]] and
other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying
signals. For given real functions representing actual physical
quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex
functions are considered of which the real parts are the original
quantities. For a [[sine_wave][sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the
absolute value  /z/ {{!}}}} of the corresponding is the [[amplitude]]
and the [[Argument_(complex_analysis)][argument]] is the
[[phase_(waves)][phase]].

If [[Fourier_analysis][Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given
real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic
functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form

$$x(t) = Re \{X( t ) \} \,$$

and

$$X( t ) = A e^{i\omega t} = a e^{ i \phi } e^{i\omega t} = a e^{i (\omega t + \phi) } \,$$

where ω represents the [[angular_frequency][angular frequency]] and the
complex number /A/ encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.

This use is also extended into [[digital_signal_processing][digital
signal processing]] and [[digital_image_processing][digital image
processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and
[[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data_compression][compress]],
restore, and otherwise process [[Digital_data][digital]]
[[Sound][audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.

Another example, relevant to the two side bands of
[[amplitude_modulation][amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:

$$\begin{align}
\cos((\omega+\alpha)t)+\cos\left((\omega-\alpha)t\right) & = \operatorname{Re}\left(e^{i(\omega+\alpha)t} + e^{i(\omega-\alpha)t}\right) \\
& = \operatorname{Re}\left((e^{i\alpha t} + e^{-i\alpha t})\cdot e^{i\omega t}\right) \\
& = \operatorname{Re}\left(2\cos(\alpha t) \cdot e^{i\omega t}\right) \\
& = 2 \cos(\alpha t) \cdot \operatorname{Re}\left(e^{i\omega t}\right) \\
& = 2 \cos(\alpha t)\cdot \cos\left(\omega t\right)\,.
\end{align}$$

** Quantum mechanics

The complex number field is intrinsic to the
[[mathematical_formulations_of_quantum_mechanics][mathematical
formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex
[[Hilbert_space][Hilbert spaces]] provide the context for one such
formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original
foundation formulas of quantum mechanics---the
[[Schrödinger_equation][Schrödinger equation]] and Heisenberg's
[[matrix_mechanics][matrix mechanics]]---make use of complex numbers.

** Relativity

In [[special_relativity][special]] and [[general_relativity][general
relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become
simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be
imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity,
but is [[Wick_rotation][used in an essential way]] in
[[quantum_field_theory][quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are
essential to [[spinor][spinors]], which are a generalization of the
[[tensor][tensors]] used in relativity.

** Geometry

*** Fractals

Certain [[fractal][fractals]] are plotted in the complex plane, e.g. the
[[Mandelbrot_set][Mandelbrot set]] and [[Julia_set][Julia sets]].

*** Triangles

Every triangle has a unique [[Steiner_inellipse][Steiner
inellipse]]---an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the
midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The
[[Focus_(geometry)][foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be
found as follows, according to [[Marden's_theorem][Marden's
theorem]]: [15] [16] Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane
as , , and . Write the [[cubic_equation][cubic equation]]
$\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0$, take its derivative, and equate the
(quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's_Theorem][Marden's Theorem]]
says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers
denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.

** Algebraic number theory

[[Pentagon construct.gif]] As mentioned above, any nonconstant
polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in *C*. A
fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients.
The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic_number][algebraic
numbers]] -- they are a principal object of study in
[[algebraic_number_theory][algebraic number theory]]. Compared to , the
algebraic closure of *Q*, which also contains all algebraic numbers, *C*
has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In
this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and
vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the
machinery of [[field_theory_(mathematics)][field theory]] to the
[[number_field][number field]] containing [[root_of_unity][roots of
unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular
[[nonagon]] [[compass_and_straightedge_constructions][using only compass
and straightedge]] -- a purely geometric problem.

Another example are [[Gaussian_integer][Gaussian integers]], that is,
numbers of the form , where and are integers, which can be used to
classify [[Fermat's_theorem_on_sums_of_two_squares][sums of squares]].

** Analytic number theory

Analytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by
taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex
numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding
number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example,
the [[Riemann_zeta_function][Riemann zeta function]] is related to the
distribution of [[prime_number][prime numbers]].

* History

The earliest fleeting reference to [[square_root][square roots]] of
[[negative_number][negative numbers]] can perhaps be said to occur in
the work of the [[Hellenistic_mathematics][Greek mathematician]]
[[Hero_of_Alexandria][Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]],
where in his /[[Hero_of_Alexandria#Bibliography][Stereometrica]]/ he
considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]]
of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term
$\scriptstyle \sqrt{81 - 144} = 3i\sqrt{7}$ in his calculations,
although negative quantities were not conceived of in
[[Greek_Mathematics][Hellenistic mathematics]] and Heron merely replaced
it by its positive ($\scriptstyle \sqrt{144 - 81} = 3\sqrt{7}$). [17]

The impetus to study complex numbers proper first arose in the 16th
century when [[algebraic_solution][algebraic solutions]] for the roots
of [[Cubic_equation][cubic]] and [[Quartic_equation][quartic]]
[[polynomial][polynomials]] were discovered by Italian mathematicians
(see [[Niccolò_Fontana_Tartaglia][Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]],
[[Gerolamo_Cardano][Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon realized that these
formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes
required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an
example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form
$\scriptstyle x^3 = px + q$ [18] gives the solution to the equation as

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left((\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}+\frac{1}{(\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}}\right).$$

At first glance this looks like nonsense. However formal calculations
with complex numbers show that the equation has solutions ,
${\scriptstyle\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\scriptstyle\frac{1}{2}}i$ and
${\scriptstyle\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\scriptstyle\frac{1}{2}}i$.
Substituting these in turn for ${\scriptstyle\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}$ in
Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and −1 as the
solutions of . Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight
but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve
cubic equations with real roots then, as later mathematicians showed
rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus_irreducibilis][is
unavoidable]]. [[Rafael_Bombelli][Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to
explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic
equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to
resolve these issues.

The term "imaginary" for these quantities was coined by
[[René_Descartes][René Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to
stress their imaginary nature [19] A further source of confusion was
that the equation $\scriptstyle \sqrt{-1}^2=\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=-1$
seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity
$\scriptstyle \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab}$, which is valid for
non-negative real numbers and , and which was also used in complex
number calculations with one of , positive and the other negative. The
incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity
$\scriptstyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}}$) in the case when
both and are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually
led to the convention of using the special symbol in place of to guard
against this mistake. Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce
students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his
elementary algebra text book, [[Elements_of_Algebra][Elements of
Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them
in a natural way throughout.

In the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed
that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to
simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance,
in 1730 [[Abraham_de_Moivre][Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the
complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer
multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle
could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which
bears his name, [[de_Moivre's_formula][de Moivre's formula]]:

$$(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^{n} = \cos n \theta + i\sin n \theta. \,$$

In 1748 [[Leonhard_Euler][Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained
[[Euler's_formula][Euler's formula]] of [[complex_analysis][complex
analysis]]:

$$\cos \theta + i\sin \theta = e ^{i\theta } \,$$

by formally manipulating complex [[power_series][power series]] and
observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric
identity to much simpler exponential identities.

The idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane
([[#Complex_plane][above]]) was first described by
[[Caspar_Wessel][Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been
anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John_Wallis][Wallis's]] /De Algebra
tractatus/.

Wessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the
[[Copenhagen_Academy][Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed.
In 1806 [[Jean-Robert_Argand][Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued
a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the
[[Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra#History][fundamental theorem of
algebra]]. Gauss had earlier published an essentially
[[topology][topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his
doubts at the time about "the true metaphysics of the square root of
−1". It was not until 1831 that he overcame these doubts and published
his treatise on complex numbers as points in the plane, largely
establishing modern notation and terminology. In the beginning of 19th
century, other mathematicians discovered independently the geometrical
representation of the complex numbers: Buée, [[C._V._Mourey][Mourey]],
[[John_Warren_(mathematician)][Warren]],
[[Jacques_Frédéric_Français][Français]] and his brother,
[[Giusto_Bellavitis][Bellavitis]]. [20]

The English mathematician [[G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] remarked that
Gauss was the first mathematician to use complex numbers in 'a really
confident and scientific way' although mathematicians such as
[[Niels_Henrik_Abel][Niels Henrik Abel]] and
[[Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi][Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] were necessarily
using them routinely before Gauss published his 1831 treatise. [21]
[[Augustin_Louis_Cauchy][Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and
[[Bernhard_Riemann][Bernhard Riemann]] together brought the fundamental
ideas of [[#Complex_analysis][complex analysis]] to a high state of
completion, commencing around 1825 in Cauchy's case.

The common terms used in the theory are chiefly due to the founders.
Argand called $\scriptstyle \cos \phi + i\sin \phi$ the /direction
factor/, and $\scriptstyle r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ the /modulus/; Cauchy
(1828) called $\cos \phi + i\sin \phi$ the /reduced form/ (l'expression
réduite) and apparently introduced the term /argument/; Gauss used for
$\scriptstyle \sqrt{-1}$, introduced the term /complex number/ for , and
called the /norm/. The expression /direction coefficient/, often used
for $\cos \phi + i\sin \phi$, is due to Hankel (1867), and /absolute
value,/ for /modulus,/ is due to Weierstrass.

Later classical writers on the general theory include
[[Richard_Dedekind][Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto_Hölder][Otto Hölder]],
[[Felix_Klein][Felix Klein]], [[Henri_Poincaré][Henri Poincaré]],
[[Hermann_Schwarz][Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl_Weierstrass][Karl
Weierstrass]] and many others.

* Generalizations and related notions

The process of extending the field *R* of reals to *C* is known as
[[Cayley–Dickson_construction][Cayley--Dickson construction]]. It can be
carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the
[[quaternion][quaternions]] *H* and [[octonion][octonions]] *O* which
(as a real vector space) are of dimension 4 and 8, respectively. In this
context the complex numbers have been called the *binarions*. [22]

However, just as applying the construction to reals loses the property
of [[ordered_field][ordering]], more properties familiar from real and
complex numbers vanish with increasing dimension. The [[quaternions]]
are only a [[skew_field][skew field]], i.e. for some : for two
quaternions, the multiplication of [[octonions]] fails (in addition to
not being commutative) to be associative: for some : .

Reals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all
[[normed_division_algebra][normed division algebras]] over *R*. However,
by [[Hurwitz's_theorem_(normed_division_algebras)][Hurwitz's theorem]]
they are the only ones. The next step in the Cayley--Dickson
construction, the [[sedenion][sedenions]], in fact fails to have this
structure.

The Cayley--Dickson construction is closely related to the
[[regular_representation][regular representation]] of *C*, thought of as
an *R*-[[Algebra_(ring_theory)][algebra]] (an *R*-vector space with a
multiplication), with respect to the basis . This means the following:
the *R*-linear map

$$\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, z \mapsto wz$$ for some fixed
complex number can be represented by a matrix (once a basis has been
chosen). With respect to the basis , this matrix is

$$\begin{pmatrix}
  \operatorname{Re}(w) & -\operatorname{Im}(w) \\
  \operatorname{Im}(w) & \;\; \operatorname{Re}(w)
\end{pmatrix}$$ i.e., the one mentioned in the section on matrix
representation of complex numbers above. While this is a
[[linear_representation][linear representation]] of *C* in the
[[2_×_2_real_matrices][2 × 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one.
Any matrix

$$J = \begin{pmatrix}p & q \\ r & -p \end{pmatrix}, \quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0$$
has the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix:
. Then

$$\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \in R \}$$ is also isomorphic to the field *C*,
and gives an alternative complex structure on *R*^{2}. This is
generalized by the notion of a [[linear_complex_structure][linear
complex structure]].

[[Hypercomplex_number][Hypercomplex numbers]] also generalize *R*, *C*,
*H*, and *O*. For example, this notion contains the
[[split-complex_number][split-complex numbers]], which are elements of
the ring (as opposed to ). In this ring, the equation has four
solutions.

The field *R* is the completion of *Q*, the field of
[[rational_number][rational numbers]], with respect to the usual
[[absolute_value][absolute value]] [[metric_(mathematics)][metric]].
Other choices of [[metric_(mathematics)][metrics]] on *Q* lead to the
fields *Q*_{/p/} of [[p-adic_number][/p/-adic numbers]] (for any
[[prime_number][prime number]] /p/), which are thereby analogous to *R*.
There are no other nontrivial ways of completing *Q* than *R* and
*Q*_{/p/}, by [[Ostrowski's_theorem][Ostrowski's theorem]]. The
algebraic closures $\overline {\mathbf{Q}_p}$ of *Q*_{/p/} still carry a
norm, but (unlike *C*) are not complete with respect to it. The
completion $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $\overline {\mathbf{Q}_p}$ turns out to be
algebraically closed. This field is called /p/-adic complex numbers by
analogy.

The fields *R* and *Q*_{/p/} and their finite field extensions,
including *C*, are [[local_field][local fields]].

[18] In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the
     cube of the sum of two cube roots:
     $\scriptstyle \left(\sqrt[3]{u} + \sqrt[3]{v}\right)^3 = 3 \sqrt[3]{uv} \left(\sqrt[3]{u} + \sqrt[3]{v}\right) + u + v$
     With $\scriptstyle x = \sqrt[3]{u} + \sqrt[3]{v}$,
     $\scriptstyle p = 3 \sqrt[3]{uv}$, $\scriptstyle q = u + v$, and
     can be expressed in terms of and as
     $\scriptstyle u = q/2 + \sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}$ and
     $\scriptstyle v = q/2 - \sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}$, respectively.
     Therefore,
     $\scriptstyle x = \sqrt[3]{q/2 + \sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}} + \sqrt[3]{q/2 - \sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}}$.
     When $\scriptstyle (q/2)^2-(p/3)^3$ is negative (casus
     irreducibilis), the second cube root should be regarded as the
     complex conjugate of the first one.

** Example
$$\sqrt{-1}$$

$$\sqrt{-9}$$

*** If imaginary unit is $i$
$$i^{2} = -1$$

*** then

$$\sqrt{-9} = i \sqrt{9} = 3i$$

** Example

$$(3i)^{2} = 3^{2} \cdot i^{2} = 9 \cdot -1 \cdot -9$$
$$(3i)^{2} = -9$$
$3i = \sqrt{-9}$

So, $3i$ is /imaginary number or unit/.

** Example
$$5 + 2i$$

You can't add real number to imaginary number.

00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:09.108
Hi, I’m Rob. Welcome to Math Antics.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.925
In this video, we’re going to learn about Polynomials.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:16.627
That’s a big math word for a really big concept in Algebra, so pay attention.

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:22.963
Now before we can understand what polynomials are, we need to learn about what mathematicians call “terms”.

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:28.900
In Algebra, terms are mathematical expressions that are made up of two different parts:

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.440
a number part and a variable part.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:36.300
In a term, the number part and the variable part are multiplied together,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.800
but since multiplication is implied in Algebra,

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:44.237
the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them.

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:49.824
The number part is pretty simple… it’s just a number, like 2 or 5 or 1.4

00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:53.974
And the number part has an official name… it’s called the “coefficient”.

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:57.394
Now there’s another cool math word that you can use to impress your friends at parties!

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.540
[party music, crowd noise]

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:04.310
…and then I said, “That’s not my wife… that’s my coefficient!”

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.450
[silence / crickets chirping]

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.014
The variable part of a term is a little more complicated.

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:14.898
It can be made up of one or more variables that are raised to a power.

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:19.738
Like… the variable part could be 'x squared'.  That’s a variable raised to a power.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.533
Or, the variable part could be just ‘y’.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:28.970
If you remember what we learned in our last video, you’ll realize that that also qualifies as a variable raised to a power.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.904
‘y’ is the same as ‘y’ to the 1st power.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:37.188
But since the exponent ‘1’ doesn’t change anything, we don’t need to actually show it.

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:42.607
Or… the variable part of a term could be some tricky combination of variables that are raised to powers,

00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:44.858
like ‘x squared’ times ‘y squared’.

00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:48.359
…or ‘a’ times ‘b squared’ times ‘c cubed’.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.612
Terms can have any number of variables like that, but the good news is that most of the time,

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:59.280
you’ll only need to deal with terms that have one variable. …or maybe two in complicated problems.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.713
Oh, and there’s one thing I should point out before we move on…

00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:09.767
if you have a term like 6y, even though it would be fine to do the multiplication the other way around and write y6,

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:15.347
it’s conventional to always write the number part of the term first and the variable part of the term second.

00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:18.200
Okay, so that’s the basic idea of a term.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.971
But there’s a little more to terms that we’ll learn in a minute.

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:27.372
First, let’s see how this basic idea of a term helps us understand the basic idea of a polynomial.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:30.825
A polynomial is a combination of many terms.

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:35.860
It’s kind of like a chain of terms that are all linked together using addition or subtraction.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.212
The terms themselves contain multiplication, but each term in a polynomial must be joined by either addition or subtraction.

00:02:44.212 --> 00:02:48.414
And polynomials can be made from any number of terms joined together,

00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:53.866
but there are a few specific names that are used to describe polynomials with a certain number of terms.

00:02:53.866 --> 00:03:01.068
If there’s only one term (which isn’t really a chain) then we call it a “monomial” because the prefix “mono” means “one”.

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:06.687
If there are just two terms, then we call it a “binomial” because the prefix “bi” means “two”,

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:12.506
and if there are three terms, then we call it a “trinomial” since the prefix “tri” means “three”.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:17.774
Beyond three terms, we usually just say “polynomial” since “poly” means “many”,

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:23.777
and in fact, it’s common to simply use the term “polynomial” even when there are just 2 or 3 terms.

00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:26.927
Okay, so that’s the basic idea of a polynomial.

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:31.462
It’s a series of terms that are joined together by addition or subtraction.

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:41.533
Now, let’s see a typical example of a polynomial that will help us learn a little more about terms:  3 ‘x squared’ plus ‘x’ minus 5

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.167
How many terms does this polynomial have?

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.118
Well, based on what we’ve learned so far, you’re probably not quit sure.

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:54.237
If the terms are the parts that are joined together by addition or subtraction, then this should have three terms,

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:57.788
but it looks like there’s something missing with the last two terms.

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:03.340
This middle term is missing its number part, and this last term is missing its variable part.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.091
That doesn’t seem to fit with our original definition of a term.  What’s up with that?

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:10.476
Well, the middle term is easy to explain.

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:13.977
There really is a number part there, but it’s just ‘1’.

00:04:13.977 --> 00:04:17.395
Do you remember how ‘1’ is always a factor of any number?

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:24.135
But, since multiplying by ‘1’ has no effect on a number or variable, we don’t need to show it.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:33.620
So, if you see a term in a polynomial that has only a variable part, you know that the number part (or coefficient) of that term is just ‘1’.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.935
Okay, but what about this last term that’s missing its variable part?

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:43.454
Well, that’s a little trickier. Do you remember in our last video about exponents in Algebra,

00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:49.641
we learned that any number or variable that’s raised to the 0th power just equals ‘1’?

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:56.021
That means we can think of this last term as having a variable ‘x’ that’s being raised to the 0th power.

00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.940
Since that would always just equal ‘1’, it’s not really a variable in the true sense of the word,

00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:03.779
and it has no effect on the value of the term.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.996
But it makes sense, especially if you remember the other rule from the last video.

00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:13.115
That rule says that any number raised to the 1st power is just itself,

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:19.550
which helps us see that this middle term is basically the same as ‘1x’ raised to the 1st power.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.168
Now do you see the pattern?

00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:28.820
Each term has a number part and each term has a variable part that is raised to a power: 0, 1 and 2.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.605
But since ‘x’ to the ‘0’ is just ‘1’,

00:05:31.605 --> 00:05:33.973
and ‘x’ to the ‘1’ is just ‘x’,

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:37.740
and anything multiplied by ‘1’ is just itself,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.826
the polynomial gets simplified so that it no longer looks exactly like the pattern it comes from.

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:47.977
Oh, and this last term… the one that doesn’t have a truly variable part…

00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:52.857
it’s called a CONSTANT term because its value always stays the same.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.232
Alright… Now that you know what a Polynomial is, let’s talk about an important property of terms and polynomials called their “degree”.

00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:07.985
Now that might sound like the units we use to measure temperature or angles, but the degree we’re talking about here is different.

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:12.302
The degree of a term is determined by the power of the variable part.

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:20.589
For example, in this term, since the power of the variable is 4, we say that the degree of the term is 4, or that it’s a 4th degree term.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:25.374
And in this term, the power of the variable is 3, so it’s a 3rd degree term.

00:06:25.374 --> 00:06:30.260
Likewise, this would be a 2nd degree term and this would be a 1st degree term.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.200
Oh, and I suppose you could call a term with no variable part a “zero degree” term,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.878
but it’s usually just referred to as a “constant term”.

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:43.247
Things are a little more complicated when you have terms with more that one variable.

00:06:43.247 --> 00:06:47.916
In that case, you add up the powers of each variable to get the degree of the term.

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:54.818
Since the powers in this term are 3 and 2, it’s a 5th degree term because 3 + 2 = 5.

00:06:54.818 --> 00:06:58.418
Okay, but why do we care about the degree of terms?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:04.421
Well, it’s because polynomials are often referred to by the degree of their highest term.

00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:10.923
If a polynomial contains a 4th degree term (but no higher terms), then it’s called a “4th degree” polynomial.

00:07:10.923 --> 00:07:17.110
But if its highest term is only a 2nd degree term, then it’s called a “2nd degree” polynomial.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.993
Another reason that we care about the degree of the terms is that it helps us decide the arrangement of a polynomial.

00:07:22.993 --> 00:07:28.046
We arrange the terms in a polynomial in order from the highest degree to the lowest.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:31.126
…ya know, cuz, mathematicians like to keep things organized…

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.400
[mumbeling] …nice… let’s see…double check…

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:46.689
Perfect!

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.700
For example, this polynomial (which has 5 terms)

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:57.160
should be rearranged so that the highest degree term is on the left, and the lowest degree term is on the right.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.320
But of course, not every polynomial has a term of every degree.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.593
This is a 5th degree polynomial, but it only has 3 terms.

00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:11.211
We should still put them in order from highest to lowest, even though it has terms that are missing.

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:14.863
So, the “4x to the fifth” should come first.

00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:17.364
And then the “minus 10x”.

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:19.698
And finally, the “plus 8”.

00:08:19.698 --> 00:08:24.583
By the way, it’s totally fine for a polynomial to have “missing” terms like that.

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:30.401
And it’s sometimes helpful to think of those missing terms as just having coefficients that are all zeros.

00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:38.254
If the coefficient of a term is zero, then the whole term has a value of zero so it wouldn’t effect the polynomial at all.

00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:39.988
And speaking of coefficients…

00:08:39.988 --> 00:08:45.757
What if we need to re-arrange this polynomial so that its terms are in order from highest degree to lowest degree?

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:52.175
The highest degree term is ‘5x squared’ but before we just move it to the front of the polynomial,

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:55.555
it’s important to notice that it’s got a minus sign in front of it.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.095
Normally when we see a minus sign, we think of subtraction, but when it comes to polynomials,

00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:09.616
it’s best to think of a minus sign as a NEGATIVE SIGN that means the term right after it has a negative value (or a negative coefficient).

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:15.268
In fact, instead of thinking of a polynomial as having terms that are added OR subtracted,

00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:19.088
it’s best to think of ALL of the terms as being ADDED,

00:09:19.088 --> 00:09:27.355
but that each term has either a POSITIVE or a NEGATIVE coefficient which is determined by the operator right in front of that term.

00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:33.623
For example, if you have this Polynomial, you should treat it as if all of the terms are being added together,

00:09:33.623 --> 00:09:39.843
and use the sign that’s directly in front of each term to tell you if it’s a positive or a negative term.

00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:44.911
This first term has a coefficient of ‘negative 4’, so it’s a negative term.

00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:49.880
The next term has a coefficient of ‘positive 6’, so it’s positive.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.015
The next term has a coefficient of ‘negative 8’, so it’s negative.

00:09:54.015 --> 00:09:57.299
And the constant term is just ‘positive 2’.

00:09:57.299 --> 00:10:01.751
And recognizing positive and negative coefficients helps us a lot when

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:07.686
rearranging polynomials that have a mixture of positive and negative terms like our example here.

00:10:07.686 --> 00:10:13.546
If you think of the negative sign in front of the ‘5x squared’ term as part of its coefficient,

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:20.200
then you’ll realize that when we move it to the front of the polynomial, the negative sign has to come with it.

00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:23.759
It has to come with it because it’s really a NEGATIVE term.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:28.642
If we don’t bring the negative sign along with it, we’ll be changing it into a positive term

00:10:28.642 --> 00:10:32.111
which would actually change the value of the polynomial.

00:10:32.111 --> 00:10:34.863
And in addition to helping us re-arrange them,

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:42.215
treating a polynomial as a combination of positive and negative terms will be very helpful when we need to simplify them,

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:46.633
which just so happens to be the subject of our next basic Algebra video.

00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:50.268
Alright, we’ve learned a LOT about polynomials in this video,

00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:55.204
and if you’re a little overwhelmed, don’t worry… it might just take some time for it all to make sense.

00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:58.186
Remember, you can always re-watch this video a few times,

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:01.439
and doing some of the practice problems will help it all sink in.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.800
As always, thanks for watching Math Antics, 
and I’ll see ya next time.

* Polynomials is a big concept in Algebra

Before we can understand what polynomials are,
we need to learn about what mathematicians call "terms".

* Terms
In Algebra, *terms* are *mathematical expressions*
that are made up of two different parts:
- a number part;
- and a variable part.

In a term. the number part and the variable part are multiplied together.

But sine multiplication is implied in Algebra,
the two parts of a term are usually written right next to each other with no times symbol between them.

Number part is called


$$3x^{2} + x - 5$$
$$3x^{2} + 1x^{1} - 5x^{0}$$

$$7x^{4}$$ is a $4^{th}$ degree term
$$7a^{3}$$ is a $3^{th}$ degree term
$$3x^{2}$$ is a $2^{th}$ degree term
$$2b^{1} = 2b$$ is a $1^{st}$ degree term
$$6x^{0} = 6$$ is a constant term or 0 degree term

* Complicated

$$8x^{3}y^{2}$$

*Add* up the *powers* of each *variable*
to get the *degree* of the term.

$$8x^{3}y^{2}$$ is a $5^{th}$ degree term, because $3 + 2 = 5$.


Polynomials *referred to by the* degree *of their highest* term.

$$7x^{4} + 3y^{2}$$ is a $4^{th}$ degree polynomial.

$$3a^{2} + b$$ is a $2^{nd}$ degree polynomial.

* Arrangement of polynomial

highest degree to the lowest degree

$$x^{3} + 3x^{4} + 5 + x + 4x^{2}$$ -> $$3x^{4} + x^{3} + 4x^{2} + x + 5$$

$$4x^{5} + 8 - 10x$$ -> $$4x^{5} - 10x + 8$$

$$4x^{5} + 0x^{4} + 0x^{3} + 0x^{2} - 10x + 8$$

Normally, when we see a minus sign, we think it's a subtraction.

But when in polynomials, it's best to think about minus sign as a *negative sign*.

*negative value or negative coefficient*

Polynomial is a combination of positive and negative terms.

* order of operations

1. () Groups or parensinsins
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and division
4. Addition and subtraction

* Distributive property
* factored out
factor out that 2

* even number

* simplifying mathematical expressions or equations

* solving equations
Solving an equation is different,
because we are trying to UNDO any operations,
that the unknown value is involved with.

So that the unknown value will be all by itself.

* factor

** testing for divisibility
We only need to test numbers that are less than half of the number we're testing.

* evenly
Divide evenly - it will divide in without a remainder

* Algebraic basic equations
The key to solving an algebraic equation is to get the unknown value all by itself on one side of the equal sign.
Getting an unknown by itself means we need to isolate it from any other numbers AND operators so that it's completely by itself.

To keep equation in balance, we need to do the same thing to both sides.

* Odd roots

* Even and odd numbers

* Common factors

* rearrange equations

* unknown taken away from number

the minus sign really belongs to the $x$ since it's the $x$ *that is being subtracted*

* Negative numbers

more negative - bigger
more negative - smaller

* exponents and roots

* equation
An equation is just a mathematical statement that two things are equal.

* goals of algebra
goals: figure out what the unknown values in equations are
and when you do that, it's called [[solving the equations]]

* how to solve equations

* different symbols
If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time,
you need to use two different symbols, like $x$ and $y$.

But we can use two different letters to represent the same number.

* algebra
In algebra, multiplication is the 'default' operation.

That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols,
then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The multiplication is 'implied'.

* multiplication sign

There are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol.

But you can use groups to get rid of the multiplication sign.

An alternative way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this.
$$(2)5$$

* Graphing an equation
Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves the can be used to describe and predict things in real life.

** linear equations
** quadratic equations

* Solving
** Group
** Exponent
** Multiplication and devision
** Addition and subtraction

* Complex numbers

** Devision
$$\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + \left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right)i$$
