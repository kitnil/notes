Reason, also known as ReasonML, is a syntax extension and toolchain for OCaml
created by Jordan Walke, who also created React, at Facebook. Reason offers a
syntax familiar to JavaScript programmers, and transpiles to OCaml. Statically
typed Reason (or OCaml) code may be compiled to dynamically typed JavaScript
using the ReScript compiler.

The Reason community officially provides ReasonReact as a solution for React
based web applications.
