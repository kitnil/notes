=== Few bash snippets ===
@Source (https://jonfhancock.com/bash-your-way-to-better-android-development-1169bc3e0424)

=== Using tail -n
//Use tail to remove the first line. Actually two lines. The first one is just a newline. The second is “List of devices attached.”
$ adb devices | tail -n +2

=== Using cut -sf
// Cut the last word and any white space off the end of each line.
$ adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf -1

=== Using xargs -I
// Given the -I option, xargs will perform an action for each line of text that we feed into it.
// We can give the line a variable name to use in commands that xargs can execute.
$ adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf -1 | xargs -I X echo X aw yiss

=== Three options below together
// Will print android version of all connected devices
adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf -1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell getprop ro.build.version.release  

=== Using alias
-- Example 1 
alias tellMeMore=echo
tellMeMore "hi there"
Output => hi there
-- Example 2
// Define alias
alias apkinstall="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X install -r $1"
// And you can use it later 
apkinstall ~/Downloads/MyAppRelease.apk  // Install an apk on all devices
-- Example 3
alias rmapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X uninstall $1"
rmapp com.example.myapp // Uninstall a package from all devices
-- Example 4
alias clearapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell pm clear $1"
clearapp com.example.myapp  // Clear data on all devices (leave installed)
-- Example 5
alias startintent="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell am start $1"
startintent https://twitter.com/JonFHancock // Launch a deep link on all devices


Setting up your .bash_profile
Finally, to make this all reusable even after rebooting your computer (aliases only last through the current session), we have to add these to your .bash_profile. You might or might not already have a .bash_profile, so let’s make sure we append to it rather than overwriting it. Just open a terminal, and run the following command

touch .bash_profile && open .bash_profile

This will create it if it doesn’t already exist, and open it in a text editor either way. Now just copy and paste all of the aliases into it, save, and close.

alias startintent="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell am start $1"
alias apkinstall="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X install -r $1"
alias rmapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X uninstall $1"
alias clearapp="adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -I X adb -s X shell pm clear $1"

* Scripting

** Prerequisite

Firstly you need to enable wireless ADB on your Android device.

https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/87da1372380ebddb60e4d89cff9a251c866e21c5/README.md
#+begin_src markdown
  Alternatively, it is possible to enable the TCP/IP connection manually using adb:

      Plug the device into a USB port on your computer.

      Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

      Get your device IP address, in Settings → About phone → Status, or by executing this command:

      adb shell ip route | awk '{print $9}'

      Enable adb over TCP/IP on your device: adb tcpip 5555.

      Unplug your device.

      Connect to your device: adb connect DEVICE_IP:5555 (replace DEVICE_IP with the device IP address you found).

      Run scrcpy as usual.

      Автозапуск
      Запуск скриптов до и после установки прошивки
      INFO
      Что еще?
      Вместо выводов

  Android основан на ядре Linux, включает в себя набор стандартных UNIX-команд и простой шелл sh. Все это значит, что мы можем не только использовать командную строку для выполнения низкоуровневых операций, но и писать шелл-скрипты, которые будут выполнять функции, недоступные из графического интерфейса. В этой статье мы поговорим о том, что с их помощью можно сделать и зачем все это нужно.

  Для прошлого номера журнала я написал статью о Tasker — системе, которая позволяет автоматизировать работу Android и заменить сотни сторонних приложений. К сожалению, Tasker ограничен высокоуровневыми функциями Android и не позволяет выполнять такие низкоуровневые операции, как монтирование файловых систем, изменение параметров ядра, системных переменных или запуск демонов. Зато все это можно сделать с помощью скриптов.

  Сразу оговорюсь, что в этой статье речь пойдет о шелл-скриптах в традиционном для Linux понимании, без использования инструментов вроде SL4A, QPython или Roboto. Главное назначение таких скриптов — изменение поведения системы, параметров ядра, работа с демонами (ADB, например) и тому подобное. Скрипты могут стартовать на этапе загрузки ОС, установки новой прошивки, после тапа по кнопке или же по традиции — из терминала.

  В статье я расскажу, как писать такие скрипты, как заставить их стартовать автоматически, привязывать к определенному системному событию. В качестве бонуса также объясню, как заставить консоль восстановления (recovery) выполнить необходимые тебе действия перед установкой или сразу после установки новой прошивки. Начинаем.

  Особенности Android-окружения

  В самой своей основе, там, где нет Java и Dalvik, Android представляет собой минималистичный Linux-дистрибутив со всеми свойственными ему атрибутами: ядром, системой инициализации, набором библиотек, демонов, консольных команд и, конечно же, шеллом. Последний — это не что иное, как mksh из MirBSD, переименованный в sh; простой командный интерпретатор с поддержкой языковых конструкций классического Bourne shell из UNIX и автодополнением по нажатию Tab.

  В качестве комплекта базовых UNIX-команд здесь используется toolbox, своего рода урезанная альтернатива BusyBox, которая позволяет вызывать несколько разных команд из одного бинарника (с помощью симлинков). Toolbox включает в себя очень ограниченный набор команд, в котором нет не только grep или sort, но даже cp. Поэтому для полноценной работы со скриптами настоятельно рекомендуется установка BusyBox, благо в маркете полно бесплатных инсталляторов.

  Сам шелл располагается не совсем по адресу, поэтому «шибанг» в скриптах будет выглядеть несколько по-иному, а именно #!/system/bin/sh. Зато о расположении бинарников можно не думать вообще, так как в переменной $PATH всегда прописаны правильные значения. Каталогов для поиска команд тут всегда три: /system/bin/, /system/sbin/ и /system/xbin/ для внешних бинарников. Туда обычно устанавливается BusyBox.

  Основное назначение скриптинга в Android — работа с ядром и системными утилитами. Ядро тут стандартное и экспортирует все те же интерфейсы /proc и /sys, через которые можно рулить железом и состоянием системы. Плюс есть набор специфичных для Android утилит, которые будут очень полезны при разработке скриптов:

      pm — менеджер пакетов, позволяет устанавливать, удалять и перемещать софт;
      am — менеджер активностей (Activity), может быть использован для запуска приложений;
      dumpsys — дамп в консоль массы различной информации о состоянии системы;
      screencap — утилита для снятия скриншота;
      screenrecord — утилита для записи скринкастов;
      getprop/setprop — команды для чтения и изменения системных переменных;
      start/stop — запуск и остановка системных служб;
      input — позволяет отправлять в текущее окно кей-коды (эмуляция клавиатуры);
      service — утилита для управления Java-сервисами, имеет очень много возможностей;
      svc — позволяет управлять Wi-Fi, USB-подключением и питанием.

  Первый пример

  Теперь давайте попробуем написать первый скрипт. Делать это лучше на компе, а еще лучше в Linux или редакторе, который умеет создавать текстовые файлы без символа возврата каретки (который при открытии в Android будет выглядеть как ^M в конце каждой строки). Наш первый скрипт будет состоять всего из двух строк, которые делают бэкап всех установленных приложений на карту памяти. Его код (требует BusyBox):

  #!/system/bin/sh

  mkdir /sdcard/backup
  cp /data/app/*.apk /sdcard/backup

  Сохраняем (пусть он называется apk_backup.sh) и перекидываем на смартфон с помощью ADB:

  $ adb push apk_backup.sh /sdcard/

  Теперь его нужно запустить. Проще всего сделать это с помощью все того же ADB:

  $ adb shell sh /sdcard/apk_backup.sh

  Примерно таким же образом скрипт можно запустить из консоли на самом смартфоне/планшете:

  $ sh /sdcard/apk_backup.sh

  Само собой, такой способ не очень удобен. Поэтому нам нужен какой-то быстрый способ запуска скрипта. Наиболее удобное из найденных мной решений — это приложение QuickTerminal. Устанавливаем, запускаем, переходим на вкладку Quick Command, нажимаем кнопку «+», вбиваем имя (произвольное) и команду (sh /sdcard/apk_backup.sh), в поле Output Type выбираем либо Dialog Output, либо Nothing. В первом случае во время выполнения скрипта на экране появится окно с результатом, во втором все пройдет в фоне. Кому что удобнее. Далее сохраняем и получаем кнопку, с помощью которой скрипт можно будет запустить быстро и легко.

  Теперь напишем скрипт, который восстановит наш бэкап:

  #!/system/bin/sh

  for i in /sdcard/backup/*; do
  pm install -t -r $i
  done

  В нем мы задействовали команду pm с опцией install и флагами -t и -r, которые заставляют систему устанавливать приложения, даже если они подписаны тестовым ключом или уже установлены. Также можно использовать флаг -s, который принуждает приложения к установке на карту памяти (если такая возможность есть), или -f — установка во внутреннюю память устройства.
  Почти все команды Android имеют подробную справку
  Почти все команды Android имеют подробную справку

  Имея рут, можно даже сделать бэкап настроек всех приложений с помощью копирования и архивации каталога /data/data/, однако восстановить его будет очень проблематично, так как в Android каждое приложение исполняется от имени созданного специально для него Linux-юзера и хранит настройки внутри каталога, принадлежащего этому пользователю. Проблема здесь в том, что идентификатор Linux-юзера для каждого приложения генерируется динамически, поэтому после восстановления бэкапа в заново установленной системе идентификаторы не будут совпадать и приложения не смогут прочитать свои настройки. Придется вручную выяснять ID юзера для каждого приложения и менять права доступа на каталоги с данными.

  С другой стороны, мы можем использовать встроенный в Android Backup Manager, позволяющий сторонним приложениям использовать возможности системы для бэкапа и восстановления приложений и их данных. Управлять им можно из консоли (а значит, и с помощью скриптов), но сам по себе он никакого бэкапа не производит, а возлагает эту работу на сторонние приложения. Helium — одно из таких приложений. Если установить и настроить его, операцию бэкапа и восстановления можно будет заскриптовать. Например, следующий простой скрипт сделает резервную копию всех сторонних приложений:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  # Получаем список всех сторонних приложений
  for i in `pm list packages -e`; do
  # Добавляем каждое из них в очередь
  bmgr backup ${i:8}
  done
  # Запускаем операцию бэкапа
  bmgr run

  Конструкция ${i:8} здесь нужна, чтобы обрезать слово «packages:», которое pm добавляет в начало имени каждого пакета. Чтобы восстановить бэкап, можно использовать либо тот же Helium, либо команду bmgr:

  $ bmgr list sets # Получаем список бэкапов
  $ bmgr restore <тег> # Восстанавливаем нужный бэкап


  Автозапуск

  «Это все круто, но скрипты должны запускаться сами», — скажешь ты и будешь абсолютно прав. Без автозапуска от скриптов толку мало, но это легко исправить, если воспользоваться все тем же Tasker. Он умеет запускать любые шелл-команды в ответ на любое событие. Чтобы воспользоваться этой функциональностью, достаточно создать новый профиль, выбрать событие (для бэкапа лучшим событием будет время), затем добавляем действие, выбираем Script -> Run Shell, вбиваем команду (sh /sdcard/script.sh), выбираем, если необходимо, файл для записи результата и включаем профиль.

  Другой популярный способ автозапуска — это использование средств автоматического исполнения скриптов при загрузке в сторонних прошивках. Сегодня почти все сколько-нибудь известные кастомные прошивки умеют стартовать скрипты из каталога /system/etc/init.d/, а в стоке такую функциональность можно получить с помощью приложения Universal init.d из маркета. С последним, однако, надо быть осторожным, так как оно запускает скрипты не на раннем этапе загрузки, как это происходит в том же CyanogenMod, а уже после полной загрузки системы.

  Итак, что мы можем поместить в автозагрузку? Например, скрипт запуска демона ADB в сетевом режиме:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555
  stop adbd
  start adbd

  Для подключения к нему с ПК набираем такую команду:

  $ adb connect IP-смартфона

  Также мы можем применить некоторые оптимизации подсистемы виртуальной памяти:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  echo "4096" > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
  echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task;
  echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom;
  echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode;
  echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
  echo "50" > /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
  echo "90" > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
  echo "70" > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio

  Ну или подогнать механизм lowmemorykiller (автоматическое убийство фоновых приложений при нехватке памяти) под наши нужды:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  echo "2048,3072,6144,15360,17920,20480" > /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/minfree

  Ну и конечно же, автоматический выбор планировщика процессов:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  echo "powersave" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  Все это можно сделать с помощью специализированного софта, но зачем загружать систему дополнительным ПО, которое еще и будет висеть в фоне, когда можно обойтись несколькими простыми скриптами?

  Запуск скриптов до и после установки прошивки

  Почти каждый, кто устанавливает на свой гаджет стороннюю прошивку, также ставит поверх нее пакет с фирменными приложениями Google (gapps), который включает в себя маркет, YouTube, Gmail и другой софт. Каждый раз, когда происходит обновление прошивки, раздел /system, содержащий ее и gapps, полностью стирается, но приложения Google всегда остаются на месте. Это происходит потому, что, кроме всего прочего, gapps содержит в своем составе специальный скрипт, который размещается в каталоге /system/addon.d/ и запускается консолью восстановления до и после установки прошивки. Этот скрипт делает бэкап и восстановление приложений Google.

  Мы можем использовать эту возможность для выполнения наших собственных действий до и после установки прошивки. Вот так, например, выглядит мой скрипт восстановления, который ничего не бэкапит, но подчищает прошивку от мусора сразу после ее установки:

  #!/sbin/sh

  # Загружаем подсобные функции
  . /tmp/backuptool.functions

  # Рингтон и звук уведомления, которые должны остаться в системе
  RINGTONE=Machina
  NOTIFICATION=Argon

  case "$1" in
  backup)
      # Пусто :)
  ;;
  restore)
      # Рингтоны, уведомления и звук будильника
      cd /system/media/audio/ringtones/
      rm [!${RINGTONE}]*.ogg
      cd /system/media/audio/notifications/
      rm [!${NOTIFICATION}]*.ogg
      rm /system/media/audio/alarms/*

      # Языки синтеза и офлайн-распознавания речи
      rm /system/tts/lang_pico/*
      rm -rf /system/usr/srec/config/*

      # Приложения
      A=/system/app/
      rm $A/Email.apk
      rm $A/Exchange2.apk
      rm $A/LockClock.apk
      rm $A/PicoTts.apk
      rm $A/Term.apk
      rm $A/ThemeChooser.apk
      rm $APPS/WAPPushManager.apk
      rm $A/LiveWallpapers.apk
      rm $A/LiveWallpapersPicker.apk
      rm $A/VisualizationWallpapers.apk
      A=/system/priv-app/
      rm $A/CMUpdater.apk
      rm $A/ThemeManager.apk
  ;;
  pre-backup)
      # ...
  ;;
  post-backup)
      # ...
  ;;
  pre-restore)
      # ...
  ;;
  post-restore)
      # ...
  ;;
  esac

  Скрипт удаляет рингтоны, уведомления, движок синтеза речи и несколько приложений. Все эти действия запускаются в ответ на передачу скрипту опции командной строки restore (это делает консоль восстановления после установки прошивки), однако также предусмотрены и варианты обработки таких опций, как backup, pre-backup, post-backup, pre-restore и post-restore. Здесь это просто заглушки, но если бы мы захотели сделать бэкап некоторых файлов и приложений перед установкой прошивки, мы могли бы добавить их в блок backup, как это сделано в скрипте /system/addon.d/70-gapps.sh:

  . /tmp/backuptool.functions

  list_files() {
  cat <<EOF
  app/GoogleContactsSyncAdapter.apk
  etc/permissions/com.google.android.maps.xml
  etc/permissions/com.google.android.media.effects.xml
  ...
  EOF
  }
  case "$1" in
  backup)
      list_files | while read FILE DUMMY; do
      backup_file $S/$FILE
  done
  ;;
  ...

  Этот кусок скрипта прекрасно иллюстрирует, как сделать бэкап файлов. Ключевые элементы здесь: функция listfiles, которая при запуске выводит листинг файлов, и функция backupfile, которая является частью консоли восстановления (определена в файле /tmp/backuptool.functions). Она делает бэкап файлов в цикле.

  INFO

  По словам разработчика mksh, изначально пользовательские версии Android-смартфонов вообще не должны были иметь в своем составе шелл, но после выпуска смартфона для разработчиков HTC (T-Mobile) G1 он фактически стал стандартной частью системы.

  Версии Android 2.3 и ниже вместо mksh использовали минималистичный шелл ash, который входит в базовый комплект всех BSD-систем.

  Чтобы получить одни и те же скрипты на всех устройствах, можно использовать приложение DropSync или FolderSync (автоматическая синхронизация через Dropbox).

  Что еще?

  С помощью скриптов в Android можно сделать намного больше, чем бэкапы и настройка параметров системы. Вот, например, скрипт, который просыпается каждые десять минут и, если уровень заряда батареи стал меньше 30%, отключает Wi-Fi и Bluetooth:

  #!/system/bin/sh

  while true; do
  if [ `cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity` -lt 30 ]; then
      svc wifi disable
      service call bluetooth_manager 8
  fi
  sleep 600
  done

  Чтобы скрипт работал в фоне, достаточно вызвать его следующим образом:

  $ script.sh &

  А это скрипт, который позволяет быстро заполнять формы, требующие ввода имэйла и пароля (в приложениях и на веб-сайтах):

  #!/system/bin/sh

  adb shell input text "user@gmail.com"
  adb shell input keyevent 23
  adb shell input keyevent 20
  adb shell input text "ПАРОЛЬ"
  adb shell input keyevent 23
  adb shell input keyevent 20

  Запускать его можно разными способами. Либо перед запуском приложения, установив задержку:

  $ sleep 15; sh /sdcard/script.sh

  Либо повесить на какое-то событие Tasker, например на взмах смартфоном. Другой вариант — использовать буфер обмена. В Android, чтобы вставить нужный текст в буфер обмена, достаточно выполнить такую команду:

  $ service call clipboard 2 i32 1 i32 1 s16 "Этот текст появится в буфере обмена"

  Не ахти как удобно, зато работает. Как мы можем использовать такую функциональность? Например, сделать простенький скрипт clip.sh:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  service call clipboard 2 i32 1 i32 1 s16 "$1"

  Соль в том, что скрипт можно вызывать через удаленный ADB либо вообще поместить в /system/etc/init.d/, заменив $1 на нужный текст. Так нужные нам данные всегда будут под рукой, а бесполезный на смартфоне механизм копирования/вставки получит хоть какое-то назначение. Консольные команды можно использовать и для более высокоуровневых операций, например позвонить по указанному номеру:

  $ am start -a android.intent.action.CALL tel:123

  Или просто открыть окно номеронабирателя с нужным номером:

  $ am start -a android.intent.action.DIAL tel:123

  Примерно таким же образом можно отправить SMS:

  #!/system/bin/sh
  am start -a android.intent.action.SENDTO -d sms:$1 --es sms_body "$2" --ez exit_on_sent true
  sleep 1
  input keyevent 22
  sleep 1
  input keyevent 66

  Скрипт принимает два аргумента: номер телефона и содержимое SMS. После запуска он откроет окно SMS-приложения, вставит в него нужный текст, а затем нажмет кнопку Enter для отправки, после чего окно закроется.

  Другие полезные при скриптинге команды:

      Перезагрузка в режим recovery:

      $ su -c reboot recovery

      Мягкая перезагрузка (без перезапуска ядра):

      $ setprop ctl.stop zygote

      Открыть нужное приложение (в данном примере — «Настройки»):

      $ am start -n com.android.settings/com.android.settings.Settings

      Открыть веб-страницу:

      $ am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW http://www.google.com

      Сообщить приложениям о низком уровне заряда батареи (есть софт, который при этом снижает свою активность):

      $ am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BATTERY_LOW

      Изменить MAC-адрес:

      $ ip link set eth0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55

      Активировать вибратор:

      $ echo 100 > /sys/devices/virtual/timed_output/vibrator/enable

      Включить фонарик:

      $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/flashlight/leds/flashlight/brightness

      Проиграть файл (может не сработать):

      $ stagefright -a -o file.mp3

      Отключить указанное приложение (можно организовать цикл для отключения bloatware по списку):

      $ pm disable com.google.android.calendar

      Получить список приложений, которые имеют уведомления в строке состояния:

      $ dumpsys statusbar | grep StatusBarNotification | awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -d '=' -f2

      Оптимизировать внутренние базы данных с настройками (можно добавить скрипт в автозагрузку, требуется BusyBox):

      #!/system/bin/sh
      for i in `find /data -iname "*.db"`; do
      sqlite3 $i 'VACUUM;'
      done

      Переключить Wi-Fi-тизеринг на основной интерфейс (нужно для обмана операторов, которые ограничивают скорость соединения при раздаче интернета по Wi-Fi):

      $ settings put global tether_dun_required 0
#+end_src

Android Studio is the recommended IDE for development, not just for launching
on Android devices and emulators but also for Linux desktop
development. Install it and configure it as follows:

    # setup android studio
    sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
    sudo snap install android-studio --classic

Use Tools > SDK Manager to install the SDK Tools > Android SDK (API 30), SDK
Tools > NDK, SDK Tools > Android SDK command line tools, and SDK Tools > CMake

Then install the Flutter plugin and restart the IDE. In Android Studio's
options for the Flutter language, enable auto format on save to match the
project's code style. If you have problems with the Dart SDK, make sure to run
`flutter` in a terminal to download it (use `source ~/.bashrc` to update your
environment variables if you're still using the same terminal from which you
ran `setup.sh`)

** android show what activities launched (debug any application)

To see what activities are launched when an application is running on an Android device, you can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool that comes with the Android SDK. Here are the steps:

    Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable and make sure USB debugging is enabled on the device. You can enable USB debugging by going to the Developer options in the device's Settings app and toggling the "USB debugging" switch.

    Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the directory where the ADB tool is located.

    Type the following command to start ADB and connect to your device:

    adb devices

    This will list all the connected Android devices. Make sure your device is listed.

    Type the following command to start monitoring the device's activity:

    adb shell "logcat ActivityManager:I *:S"

    This will show all the activity manager logs with a priority level of "Info" and suppress all logs with other priority levels.

    Launch the application you want to debug on your device.

    Check the activity manager logs in the terminal or command prompt window. You should see the activities launched by the application listed in the logs.

Note: The logs may contain a lot of information, so it may be helpful to filter the logs by the application's package name. You can do this by adding the package name as a filter to the logcat command. For example:

adb shell "logcat ActivityManager:I *:S | grep com.example.app"

This will only show the logs related to the application with the package name "com.example.app". Replace "com.example.app" with the actual package name of the application you want to debug.

** Could I get network traffic from android device, e.g. to reverse API used by application?

Yes, you can capture network traffic from an Android device to reverse engineer the APIs used by an application. One way to do this is to use a network traffic analysis tool, such as Wireshark or Fiddler, and set up a proxy server on your computer to capture the traffic between the device and the application's server.

Here are the steps to capture network traffic from an Android device using Wireshark:

    Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable and make sure USB debugging is enabled on the device.

    Install and run Wireshark on your computer.

    Set up a proxy server on your computer by going to the Wireshark menu, selecting "Edit" -> "Preferences", and then selecting the "Proxies" tab. Under "HTTP Proxy", check the "Enabled" box and set the "Proxy server" to "127.0.0.1" and the "Proxy port" to "8888".

    Set up the Android device to use the proxy server by going to the device's Wi-Fi settings, long-pressing the network you're connected to, selecting "Modify network", and then selecting "Advanced options". Under "Proxy", select "Manual", and set the "Proxy hostname" to "127.0.0.1" and the "Proxy port" to "8888".

    Launch the application you want to reverse engineer on your Android device.

    In Wireshark, select the network interface that corresponds to the Wi-Fi network you're connected to and start capturing packets.

    Use the application on your device and perform the actions that you want to capture the network traffic for.

    Stop the packet capture in Wireshark and filter the captured packets by the IP address of the application's server. This will show you the network traffic between the application and its server.

    Analyze the captured packets to reverse engineer the APIs used by the application.

Note: Some applications may use encrypted traffic, such as HTTPS, which can make it more difficult to analyze the network traffic. In this case, you may need to use additional tools or techniques to decrypt the traffic.
