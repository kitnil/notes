** Configure journald send logs to remote server.

To configure journald to send logs to a remote server, you can follow these steps:

    Create a configuration file in /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/ directory with the following content:

    makefile

[Journal]
ForwardToSyslog=yes
SyslogIdentifier=<IDENTIFIER>
SyslogFacility=<FACILITY>
SyslogLevel=<LEVEL>

Replace <IDENTIFIER> with the identifier that you want to use for your logs, <FACILITY> with the syslog facility you want to use, and <LEVEL> with the syslog level you want to use.

Restart the journald service to apply the changes:

ruby

$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald.service

Install rsyslog on the remote server:

ruby

$ sudo apt install rsyslog

Open the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and add the following line to the end of the file:

ruby

*.* @@<REMOTE_IP>:<REMOTE_PORT>

Replace <REMOTE_IP> with the IP address of the remote server and <REMOTE_PORT> with the port number you want to use for logging.

Restart the rsyslog service:

ruby

    $ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service

Once these steps are completed, the journald logs should be forwarded to the remote server using rsyslog.


** What is SyslogFacility in journald config?

In the journald configuration, SyslogFacility specifies the syslog facility identifier that journald uses when sending log messages to the syslog protocol. The facility identifies the type of program or service that generated the message.

The possible values for SyslogFacility are:

    0: kernel messages
    1: user-level messages
    2: mail system
    3: system daemons
    4: security/authorization messages (note: this facility is not included in the syslog protocol standards)
    5: messages generated internally by syslogd
    6: line printer subsystem
    7: network news subsystem
    8: UUCP subsystem
    9: clock daemon
    10: security/authorization messages (note: this facility is not included in the syslog protocol standards)
    11: FTP daemon
    12: NTP subsystem
    13: log audit
    14: log alert
    15: clock daemon (note: deprecated by 12)
    16: local use 0 (local0)
    17: local use 1 (local1)
    18: local use 2 (local2)
    19: local use 3 (local3)
    20: local use 4 (local4)
    21: local use 5 (local5)
    22: local use 6 (local6)
    23: local use 7 (local7)

The default value for SyslogFacility is daemon, which corresponds to 3 (system daemons).

** Show me a journald config to send logs to remote `rsyslog`.

To configure journald to send logs to a remote rsyslog server, you can create a new configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/remote.conf with the following content:

makefile

[Journal]
ForwardToSyslog=yes
SyslogFacility=daemon

The ForwardToSyslog directive enables forwarding of journal messages to syslog. The SyslogFacility directive specifies the syslog facility to use when forwarding messages to syslog.

After creating or modifying the configuration file, you need to restart the systemd-journald service to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald

Next, you need to configure the remote rsyslog server to receive and store the forwarded logs. The exact configuration steps may depend on your specific rsyslog version and environment, but in general, you need to:

    Open the rsyslog configuration file, usually located at /etc/rsyslog.conf or /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf.

    Add a new configuration block to define the input source for remote logs. For example:

    bash

# Listen for remote logs on UDP port 514
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514

You can also use a different transport protocol, such as TCP or RELP, depending on your needs and security requirements.

Add a new configuration block to define the destination for forwarded logs. For example:

graphql

# Forward logs from journald to remote server at 10.0.0.1
*.* @@10.0.0.1:514

This configuration sends all messages from all facilities and priorities (*.*) to the remote rsyslog server at IP address 10.0.0.1 and port 514.

Restart the rsyslog service to apply the changes.

    sudo systemctl restart rsyslog

After completing these steps, journald should start forwarding logs to the remote rsyslog server, and rsyslog should be able to receive and store them according to its own configuration.

** Is it possible to use a domain name instead of`10.0.0.1` in your previous example?

Yes, it is possible to use a domain name instead of an IP address in the journald configuration to send logs to a remote rsyslog server. You can replace the IP address in the RemoteSyslog configuration line with the domain name of the rsyslog server, like this:

makefile

[Remote]
# Set up remote logging
Remote=yes
SyslogFacility=daemon
LogLevel=info
# Replace 10.0.0.1 with the domain name of your rsyslog server
RemoteServerName=example.com
RemoteServerPort=514

Note that you need to replace example.com with the actual domain name of your rsyslog server. Also, make sure that the domain name can be resolved by the system running journald.
