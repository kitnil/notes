Harry Schwartz demonstrates some of the nifty features of Org mode

"Org mode is an outliner, markup language, task manager, calendar, contact
manager, and who-knows-what-else. I use it to write documents and presentations,
manage my todo list, and I even write my Emacs configuration in it.

In other words, Org is taking over my life.

Iâ€™ll be introducing some of the functionality of Org, demonstrating what it can
do, and showing how you, too, can become pleasantly obsessed with a wacky,
overgrown outlining tool."
