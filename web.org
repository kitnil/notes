 This script listens to meetings I'm supposed to be paying attention to and pings me on hipchat when my name is mentioned.

 It sends me a transcript of what was said in the minute before my name was mentioned and some time after.

 It also plays an audio file out loud 15 seconds after my name was mentioned which is a recording of me saying, "Sorry, I didn't realize my mic was on mute there."

 Uses IBM's Speech to Text Watson API for the audio-to-text.

 Currently relies on Splunk as a data store, but can be extended to use an open-source tool instead.

 Relies on Uberi's SpeechRecognition PyAudio and API wrapper: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition

 <2016-12-14 Wed 07:56>

 STARTTLS Everywhere
 Example usage

 WARNING: this is a pre-alpha codebase. Do not run it on production mailservers!!!

 If you have a Postfix server you're willing to endanger deliverability on, you can try obtain a certificate with the Let's Encrypt Python Client, note the directory it lives in below /etc/letsencrypt/live and then do:

 git clone https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere
 cd starttls-everywhere
 # Promise you don't care if deliverability breaks on this mail server
 letsencrypt-postfix/PostfixConfigGenerator.py examples/starttls-everywhere.json /etc/postfix /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR.DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM

 This will:

     Ensure your mail server initiates STARTTLS encryption
     Install the Let's Encrypt cert in Postfix
     Enforce mandatory TLS to some major email domains
     Enforce minimum TLS versions to some major email domains

 <2016-12-20 Tue 13:58>

 This source tree started as a re-distribution of those NX packages needed to setup FreeNX and/or X2Go on a Linux server.

 In the past, the NX re-distribution (3.5.0.x) had been maintained by the X2Go Project: http://wiki.x2go.org

 In 2014, the QVD project run by the company Qindel joined the group of people being interested in NX maintenance and improvement.

 Since 2015, the Arctica Project has joined in the NX development. The core devs of X2Go, Arctica and TheQVD have agreed on stopping to redistribute NX and to continue the development of NX 3.x as the new upstream instead. The package will see a slight name change to nx-libs starting with version 3.5.99.0.

 Our intentions for nx-libs are:

     provide one tarball that builds NX projects via a common Makefile
     provide one tarball for distribution packagers
     provide support for security issues
     provide support for latest X11 extensions
     improve NX where possible

 This source tree is maintained on Github:

 https://github.com/ArcticaProject/nx-libs (3.6.x branch)

 For the the post-NoMachine era of nx-libs, we will focus on two release phases for the upcoming two years (06/2015 - 06/2017).

 <2016-12-22 Thu 11:39>

 A small python seed to create a Whatsapp Bot, with regex-callback routes (just like a web framework).
 (practical extension of the examples on https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup)
 ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

 Unfortunately, after some updates in the whatsapp servers, bots are beeing banned real quickly. Some just last a couple hours.
 Whatsapp does not have an open protocol, so yowsup -- the core implementation behind this seed -- relies on reverse engineering to understand the messages exchange. Right now there is a lot of issues with this implementation.
 This project had a good run, was really useful and bots prior to the server update could run for months without any trouble. Right now is very unstable and unreliable due the ban problem.
 If a new library/protocol update solves this issue, the work will return. Until then, sadly, the project will be on hold.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 00:53>
 OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share files of any size. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the files. It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.

 Features include:

     A user-friendly drag-and-drop graphical user interface that works in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
     Ability to share multiple files and folders at once
     Support for multiple people downloading files at once
     Automatically copies the unguessable URL to your clipboard
     Shows you the progress of file transfers
     When file is done transferring, automatically closes OnionShare to reduce the attack surface
     Localized into several languages, and supports international unicode filenames

 If you're interested in exactly what OnionShare does and does not protect against, read the Security Design Document.

Journals are stored as human readable plain text files - you can put them into a Dropbox folder for instant syncing and you can be assured that your journal will still be readable in 2050, when all your fancy iPad journal applications will long be forgotten.

 jrnl also plays nice with the fabulous DayOne and can read and write directly from and to DayOne Journals.

 Optionally, your journal can be encrypted using the 256-bit AES.
 Why keep a journal?

 Journals aren't only for 13-year old girls and people who have too much time on their summer vacation. A journal helps you to keep track of the things you get done and how you did them. Your imagination may be limitless, but your memory isn't. For personal use, make it a good habit to write at least 20 words a day. Just to reflect what made this day special, why you haven't wasted it. For professional use, consider a text-based journal to be the perfect complement to your GTD todo list - a documentation of what and how you've done it.

 gitfs Build Status Coverage Status
 Welcome to GitFS

 gitfs is a FUSE file system that fully integrates with git. You can mount a remote repository's branch locally, and any subsequent changes made to the files will be automatically committed to the remote.
 What's its purpose?

 gitfs was designed to bring the full powers of git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning. A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch you're currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.

 gitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your files, but at the same time you don't have the possibility of organizing everything into commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git repositories, with local cache
 Features

     Automatically commits changes: create, delete, update files and their metadata
     Browse through working index and commit history
     Merges with upstream by automatically accepting local changes
     Caching commits reduces the memory footprint and speeds up navigation
     Reduces the number of pushes by batching commits

 You have just found Keras.

 Keras is a high-level neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

 Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

     Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through total modularity, minimalism, and extensibility).
     Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
     Supports arbitrary connectivity schemes (including multi-input and multi-output training).
     Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

 Read the documentation at Keras.io.

 Keras is compatible with: Python 2.7-3.5.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 07:19>

 Use a deep neural network to borrow the skills of real artists and turn your two-bit doodles into masterpieces! This project is an implementation of Semantic Style Transfer (Champandard, 2016), based on the Neural Patches algorithm (Li, 2016). Read more about the motivation in this in-depth article and watch this workflow video for inspiration.

 The doodle.py script generates a new image by using one, two, three or four images as inputs depending what you're trying to do: the original style and its annotation, and a target content image (optional) with its annotation (a.k.a. your doodle). The algorithm extracts annotated patches from the style image, and incrementally transfers them over to the target image based on how closely they match.

 NOTE: Making a #NeuralDoodle is a skill. The parameters in the script were adjusted to work well by default and with the examples below. For new images, you may need to adjust values and modify on your input data too. It takes practice, but you can reach almost photo-realistic results if you iterate!

 A lightweight REST miniframework for Python.

 Documentation is at http://restless.readthedocs.org/.

 Works great with Django, Flask, Pyramid, Tornado & Itty, but should be useful for many other Python web frameworks. Based on the lessons learned from Tastypie & other REST libraries.
 Features

     Small, fast codebase
     JSON output by default, but overridable
     RESTful
     Python 3.2+ (with shims to make broke-ass Python 2.6+ work)
     Flexible

 Anti-Features

 (Things that will never be added...)

     Automatic ORM integration
     Authorization (per-object or not)
     Extensive filtering options
     XML output (though you can implement your own)
     Metaclasses
     Mixins
     HATEOAS

 Why?

 Quite simply, I care about creating flexible & RESTFul APIs. In building Tastypie, I tried to create something extremely complete & comprehensive. The result was writing a lot of hook methods (for easy extensibility) & a lot of (perceived) bloat, as I tried to accommodate for everything people might want/need in a flexible/overridable manner.

 But in reality, all I really ever personally want are the RESTful verbs, JSON serialization & the ability of override behavior.

 This one is written for me, but maybe it's useful to you.

 top-starred-devs-and-repos-to-follow

     The Top-Starred Python GitHub Devs, Orgs, and Repos to Follow (All-Time and Trending)

 Why?

 Why follow the top-starred Python GitHub devs?

     Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:

         Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects

         You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.

         To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start following them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.

     Inspired by the following Reddit post.

 After reading through the post, I was curious to see a similar list for Python GitHub devs, orgs, and repos.
 'Top-Starred'?

 There's no definitive way to determine 'top' devs, orgs, and repos by language. Every metric has its flaws. The lists below look at total number of stars in Python repositories, which seems to be a decent metric that is readily available/easy to mine.

 Dev stats are for individual contributors. Org stats are also provided: viewing the org link shows the devs who are part of the org. Not sure how you'd measure stats for each dev part of an org, or similarly, devs contributing to other projects.

 GitHub is not perfect in classifying repos as Python. The lists below try to manually filter out mis-classified repos.

 I found it interesting to track 'all time' and 'trending' stats, so lists for each are included. Sources are provided after each list.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 07:42>

 What is it

 pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.
 Main Features

 Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

     Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
     Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
     Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations
     Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
     Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
     Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
     Intuitive merging and joining data sets
     Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
     Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
     Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format
     Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.

 Mailpile (https://www.mailpile.is/) is a modern, fast web-mail client with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of Mailpile is funded by a large community of backers and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI approved Free Software license.

 Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user interface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to make it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed e-mail.

 Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology for the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop application (accessed by visiting localhost in the browser) or a remote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

 The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

 Note: We are currently "in beta", which means the app's basic features are (mostly) in place and packages are available for popular operating systems, for people who would like to help test and debug. For more details follow @MailpileTeam on Twitter or read our blog.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 08:44>

 Repren is a simple but flexible, command-line tool for rewriting file contents according to a set of regular expression patterns, and renaming or moving files. Essentially, it is a general-purpose, brute-force text file refactoring tool.

 For example, repren can perform a Java refactor that involves renaming the Java class filename, as well as every occurrence of that class name in code or documentation. Or it can change the naming scheme for files, so every path like foo.1.jpg is renamed foo-1.jpg. Or it can move files by rewriting parent directories.

 It's strives to be more powerful and thoughtful than usual options like perl -pie, rpl, sed, or rename:

     It can do search-and-replace, file renaming, or both.
     It allows file renaming on full paths, including moving files, creating directories, or rewriting directory hierarchies.
     It supports fully expressive regular expressions, with capturing groups and back substitutions.
     It performs simultaneous group renamings, i.e. rename "foo" as "bar", and "bar" as "foo" at once, without requiring a temporary intermediate rename.
     It is careful. It has a nondestructive mode, and prints clear stats on its changes. It leaves backups. File operations are done atomically, so interruptions never leave a previously existing file truncated or partly edited.
     It supports helpful variations like an option to replace on word breaks, so you avoid splitting a word, and "case-preserving" renames that let you find and rename identifiers with case variants (lowerCamel, UpperCamel, lower_underscore, and UPPER_UNDERSCORE) consistently.
     It has this nice documentaion!

 <2016-12-14 Wed 08:52>

 explainshell is a tool (with a web interface) capable of parsing man pages, extracting options and explain a given command-line by matching each argument to the relevant help text in the man page.
 How?

 explainshell is built from the following components:

     man page reader which converts a given man page from raw format to html (manpage.py)
     classifier which goes through every paragraph in the man page and classifies it as contains options or not (algo/classifier.py)
     an options extractor that scans classified paragraphs and looks for options (options.py)
     a storage backend that saves processed man pages to mongodb (store.py)
     a matcher that walks the command's AST (parsed by bashlex) and contextually matches each node to the relevant help text (matcher.py)

 When querying explainshell, it:

     parses the query into an AST
     visits interesting nodes in the AST, such as:
         command nodes - these nodes represent a simple command
         shell related nodes - these nodes represent something the shell interprets such as '|', '&&'
     for every command node we check if we know how to explain the current program, and then go through the rest of the tokens, trying to match each one to the list of known options
     returns a list of matches that are rendered with Flask

 jrnl is a simple journal application for your command line. Journals are stored as human readable plain text files - you can put them into a Dropbox folder for instant syncing and you can be assured that your journal will still be readable in 2050, when all your fancy iPad journal applications will long be forgotten.

 jrnl also plays nice with the fabulous DayOne and can read and write directly from and to DayOne Journals.

 Optionally, your journal can be encrypted using the 256-bit AES.
 Why keep a journal?

 Journals aren't only for 13-year old girls and people who have too much time on their summer vacation. A journal helps you to keep track of the things you get done and how you did them. Your imagination may be limitless, but your memory isn't. For personal use, make it a good habit to write at least 20 words a day. Just to reflect what made this day special, why you haven't wasted it. For professional use, consider a text-based journal to be the perfect complement to your GTD todo list - a documentation of what and how you've done it.

 Clint is awesome. Crazy awesome. It supports colors, but detects if the session is a TTY, so doesn't render the colors if you're piping stuff around. Automagically.

 Awesome nest-able indentation context manager. Example: (with indent(4): puts('indented text')). It supports custom email-style quotes. Of course, it supports color too, if and when needed.

 It has an awesome Column printer with optional auto-expanding columns. It detects how wide your current console is and adjusts accordingly. It wraps your words properly to fit the column size. With or without colors mixed in. All with a single function call.

 The world's easiest to use implicit argument system w/ chaining methods for filtering. Seriously.

 Run the various executables in examples to get a good feel for what Clint offers.

 dumb-init is a simple process supervisor and init system designed to run as PID 1 inside minimal container environments (such as Docker). It is deployed as a small, statically-linked binary written in C.

 Lightweight containers have popularized the idea of running a single process or service without normal init systems like systemd or sysvinit. However, omitting an init system often leads to incorrect handling of processes and signals, and can result in problems such as containers which can't be gracefully stopped, or leaking containers which should have been destroyed.

 dumb-init enables you to simply prefix your command with dumb-init. It acts as PID 1 and immediately spawns your command as a child process, taking care to properly handle and forward signals as they are received.

 Gitless is an experimental version control system built on top of Git. Many people complain that Git is hard to use.

Gitless is an experiment to see what happens if you put a simple veneer on an app that changes the underlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented on top of Git (could be considered what Git pros call a "porcelain" of Git), you can always fall back on Git.

 What's its purpose?

 gitfs was designed to bring the full powers of git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning. A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch you're currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.

 gitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your files, but at the same time you don't have the possibility of organizing everything into commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git repositories, with local cache
 Features

     Automatically commits changes: create, delete, update files and their metadata

 About

 Herd is a torrent-based file distribution system based on Murder. It allows for quick and easy transfer of small and large files. You can probably use it for other things too.

 Herd requires no extra Python modules and includes everything needed for destinations including its own (lightly modified) copy of BitTornado.

 Herd has been updated from its fork Horde which removed limitations around large file transfers, peer seeding, and python integration. Herd now has the same capabilities as Horde in that regard.

 Introduction

 CMS, or Contest Management System, is a distributed system for running and (to some extent) organizing a programming contest.

 CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types of contests, tasks, scorings, etc. Nonetheless, CMS has been explicitly build to be used in the 2012 International Olympiad in Informatics, held in September 2012 in Italy.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 09:53>

 Orchestra is a system for orchestrating project teams of experts and machines. Projects can include everything from design teams working on a client's project to newsrooms bringing together reporters, photographers, and editors for a story. In Orchestra workflows, you can assign senior experts to review other experts in order to provide feedback and iteratively refine the work. Orchestra also brings machines and automation onto projects: a crawler can collect content from the web before an expert combs through it, or a classifier can filter out bad data so an analyst spends less time in the noise. New workflows can be added with some simple python glue and an html interface.

 To learn more about Orchestra with some examples and a getting started guide, or to reach out to the Orchestra team, take a look at some of these resources:

 RedditStorage is an application that allows you to store on reddit subreddits via raw bytes. The file is encoded into characters and encrypted using AES encryption, after which it can be stored on a subreddit of choice (ideally your own private subreddit). To retrieve the file, the process is simply reversed. Unfortunately, reddit comments have a character limit of 10000. If your file exceeds that amount, it will be split up among comments in the same thread which form links by replying to each other.

 <2016-12-14 Wed 10:54>

 Demimove is a mass renaming file browser for Linux and Windows, written with python2.7 and PyQt4.

 A couple of features you might find interesting:

     Interactivity: Demimove allows adding/removing of (multiple) targets quickly by mouse interaction (instead of or complementary to matching via regex/globbing patterns).
     Automatic Previews: Demimove provides an automatic and immediate preview of any change.
     Performance: Demimove is fast, thanks to Qt and its QFileSystemModel. Even thousands of files are no problem (although there's a ceiling, as always).
     Commit History: You can undo any commit, although currently only in order of last to first.
     Multiple Pattern Support: You can have any number of match and filter patterns by separating them with a slash ("/").
     Recursive support: Demimove supports recursive lookups and renames. You can specify the depth of the recursion.
     Config File: You can save and restore options to and from a file (~/.config/demimove/demimove.ini).

 Other than that, it hopefully comes with everything you'd expect from a standard mass renamer, including regex/globbing support and preconfigured actions.

 TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit.

 TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

 <2016-12-15 Thu 09:22>

 This project is an attempt to build a graph database ontop of Redis using Redis modules, where the nodes in the graph represents entities such as a person or a place and connections such as 'visit' are made between the different entities.

 As entities might have several attributes Redis hashes seems ideal to hold them, as such a node in the graph is named after an entity's key, for example supose we had a persone entity representing Barack Obama, our entity's key within redis would be "Barack Obama" and two of its attributes could be Age (55) and profession, we could also have another entity under the key Hawaii. with an attribute population (1,442,949). Finally we could construct a simple graph by connecting Barak Obama with an edge representing the relation born to Hawaii.

 This is one of the key ideas behind this project; a node in the graph is simply a reference to an entity stored as Redis hash.

 This program reads a C source file and prints an equivalent module in Rust syntax. It's intended to be useful for two different purposes:

     Partial automation for migrating legacy code that was implemented in C. (This tool does not fully automate the job because its output is only as safe as the input was; you should clean up the output afterward to use Rust features and idioms where appropriate.)

     A new, complementary approach to static analysis for C programs. If this program can't translate your C source to equivalent Rust, you might consider whether your program is too complicated and hiding bugs. Or, if translation succeeds, the Rust compiler may report warnings and errors that your C compiler misses, or you may be able to use a custom Rust linter to detect project-specific problems.

 Introduction

 This is a collection of CMake modules that I've produced during the course of a variety of software development. There are a number of find modules, especially for virtual reality and physical simulation packages, some utility modules of more general interest, and some patches or workarounds for CMake itself.

 Each module is generally documented, and depending on how busy I was when I created it, the documentation can be fairly complete.

 By now, it also includes contributions both from open-source projects I work on, as well as friendly strangers on the Internet contributing their modules. I am very grateful for improvements/fixes/pull requests!

 <2016-12-15 Thu 11:15>

 Flocker is an open-source Container Data Volume Manager for your Dockerized applications.

 By providing tools for data migrations, Flocker gives ops teams the tools they need to run containerized stateful services like databases in production.

 Unlike a Docker data volume which is tied to a single server, a Flocker data volume, called a dataset, is portable and can be used with any container, no matter where that container is running.

 Flocker manages Docker containers and data volumes together. When you use Flocker to manage your stateful microservice, your volumes will follow your containers when they move between different hosts in your cluster.

 You can also use Flocker to manage only your volumes, while continuing to manage your containers however you choose.

 An update to Jeff Sharkey's excellent logcat color script which only shows log entries for processes from a specific application package.

 During application development you often want to only display log messages coming from your app. Unfortunately, because the process ID changes every time you deploy to the phone it becomes a challenge to grep for the right thing.

 This script solves that problem by filtering by application package. Supply the target package as the sole argument to the python script and enjoy a more convenient development process.

 <2016-12-15 Thu 11:51>

 Logster is a utility for reading log files and generating metrics to configurable outputs. It is ideal for visualizing trends of events that are occurring in your application/system/error logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the number of occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server logs.

 Logster maintains a cursor, via a tailer, on each log file that it reads so that each successive execution only inspects new log entries. In other words, a 1 minute crontab entry for logster would allow you to generate near real-time trends in the configured output for anything you want to measure from your logs.

 This tool is made up of a framework script, logster, and parsing classes that are written to accommodate your specific log format. Sample parsers are included in this distribution. The parser classes essentially read a log file line by line, apply a regular expression to extract useful data from the lines you are interested in, and then aggregate that data into metrics that will be submitted to the configured output. The sample parsers should give you some idea of how to get started writing your own. A list of available parsers can be found on the Parsers page.

 Graphite, Ganglia, Amazon CloudWatch, Nagios, StatsD and stdout outputs are provided, and Logster also supports the use of third-party output classes. A list of available output classes can be found on the Outputs page.

 <2016-12-16 Fri 04:38>

 The aim of devtools is to make package development easier by providing R functions that simplify common tasks.

 An R package is actually quite simple. A package is a template or set of conventions that structures your code. This not only makes sharing code easy, it reduces the time and effort required to complete you project: following a template removes the need to have to think about how to organize things and paves the way for the creation of standardised tools that can further accelerate your progress.

 While package development in R can feel intimidating, devtools does every thing it can to make it less so. In fact, devtools comes with a small guarantee: if you get an angry e-mail from an R-core member because of a bug in devtools, forward me the email and your address and I'll mail you a card with a handwritten apology.

 devtools is opinionated about package development. It requires that you use roxygen2 for documentation and testthat for testing. Not everyone would agree with this approach, and they are by no means perfect. But they have evolved out of the experience of writing over 30 R packages.

 I'm always happy to hear about what doesn't work for you and where devtools gets in your way. Either send an email to the rdevtools mailing list or file an issue at the GitHub repository.

 Here's an random, non cherry-picked, example of what this network can do. From left to right, the first column is the 16x16 input image, the second one is what you would get from a standard bicubic interpolation, the third is the output generated by the neural net, and on the right is the ground truth.

 <2016-12-16 Fri 08:00>



 Repren is a simple but flexible, command-line tool for rewriting file contents according to a set of regular expression patterns, and renaming or moving files. Essentially, it is a general-purpose, brute-force text file refactoring tool.

 For example, repren can perform a Java refactor that involves renaming the Java class filename, as well as every occurrence of that class name in code or documentation. Or it can change the naming scheme for files, so every path like foo.1.jpg is renamed foo-1.jpg. Or it can move files by rewriting parent directories.

 It's strives to be more powerful and thoughtful than usual options like perl -pie, rpl, sed, or rename:

     It can do search-and-replace, file renaming, or both.
     It allows file renaming on full paths, including moving files, creating directories, or rewriting directory hierarchies.
     It supports fully expressive regular expressions, with capturing groups and back substitutions.
     It performs simultaneous group renamings, i.e. rename "foo" as "bar", and "bar" as "foo" at once, without requiring a temporary intermediate rename.
     It is careful. It has a nondestructive mode, and prints clear stats on its changes. It leaves backups. File operations are done atomically, so interruptions never leave a previously existing file truncated or partly edited.
     It supports helpful variations like an option to replace on word breaks, so you avoid splitting a word, and "case-preserving" renames that let you find and rename identifiers with case variants (lowerCamel, UpperCamel, lower_underscore, and UPPER_UNDERSCORE) consistently.
     It has this nice documentaion!

 googler is a power tool to Google (Web & News) and Google Site Search from the command-line. It shows the title, URL and abstract for each result, which can be directly opened in a browser from the terminal. Results are fetched in pages (with page navigation). Supports sequential searches in a single googler instance.

 googler was initially written to cater to headless servers without X. You can integrate it with a text-based browser. However, it has grown into a very handy and flexible utility that delivers much more. For example, fetch any number of results or start anywhere, limit search by any duration, define aliases to google search any number of websites, switch domains easily... all of this in a very clean interface without ads or stray URLs. The shell completion scripts make sure you don't need to remember any options.

It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

 Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

 <2016-12-21 Wed 10:46>

 At Stripe, we've long had many more Google Group mailing lists than employees. As the number of lists grew, so too did the complexity of managing your email setup: which lists were you on? Why are you receiving email for this list you're not subscribed to? How do you set up your filters to usually archive email to a list, but only if you're not present on the CC?

 Gaps is the main tool we've used to help make these questions manageable. The core functionality is surprisingly simple: a single list of all your Google Groups in one place, which lets you view your subscriptions (including whether you're receiving mail from a list being subscribed to another list), and subscribe or unsubscribe by the click of a button.

 More recently, we've also added filter generation and maintenance. Unfortunately Google's email settings API only allows you to create new filters, so it's up to the user to delete their old ones.

 We don't have a mailing list; but we are always happy to answer questions on gitter chat or filed as issues in our trackers:

     mypy tracker for mypy isues
     typeshed tracker for issues with specific modules
     typing tracker for discussion of new type system features (PEP 484 changes) and runtime bugs in the typing module

 What is mypy?

 Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python. You can add type hints to your Python programs using the standard for type annotations introduced in Python 3.5 (PEP 484), and use mypy to type check them statically. Find bugs in your programs without even running them!

 The type annotation standard has also been backported to earlier Python 3.x versions. Mypy supports Python 3.3 and later.

 For Python 2.7, you can add annotations as comments (this is also specified in PEP 484).

 You can mix dynamic and static typing in your programs. You can always fall back to dynamic typing when static typing is not convenient, such as for legacy code.

 Here is a small example to whet your appetite:

** [[https://github.com/amperser/proselint][amperser/proselint: A linter for prose.]] :python:github:top:prose:writing:linter: 
 <2016-12-22 Thu 00:46>

 Writing is notoriously hard, even for the best writers, and it's not for lack of good advice — a tremendous amount of knowledge about the craft is strewn across usage guides, dictionaries, technical manuals, essays, pamphlets, websites, and the hearts and minds of great authors and editors. But poring over Strunk & White hardly makes one a better writer — it turns you into neither Strunk nor White. And nobody has the capacity to apply all the advice from Garner’s Modern American Usage, a 975-page usage guide, to everything they write. In fact, the whole notion that one becomes a better writer by reading advice on writing rests on untenable assumptions about learning and memory. The traditional formats of knowledge about writing are thus essentially inert, waiting to be transformed.

 We devised a simple solution: proselint, a linter for prose. (A linter is a computer program that, like a spell checker, scans through a document and analyzes it.)

 proselint places the world’s greatest writers and editors by your side, where they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose. You’ll be guided by advice inspired by Bryan Garner, David Foster Wallace, Chuck Palahniuk, Steve Pinker, Mary Norris, Mark Twain, Elmore Leonard, George Orwell, Matthew Butterick, William Strunk, E.B. White, Philip Corbett, Ernest Gowers, and the editorial staff of the world’s finest literary magazines and newspapers, among others. Our goal is to aggregate knowledge about best practices in writing and to make that knowledge immediately accessible to all authors in the form of a linter for prose.

 proselint is a command-line utility that can be integrated into existing tools.

 Git-lint is a tool for improving source code one step at a time.
 Motivation

 Often times enforcing coding styles to an existing project can be a nightmare. Some reasons may include:

     the codebase is already a mess and the output of the tools is overwhelming.
     developers don't feel confident changing lines they do not own.
     or they just don't know what tool to use.

 Features

 This tool tackles all the 3 problems mentioned above by providing just a single tool that lints all the modified files. For each filetype it may use even more than one linter or tool. Furthermore by default it only report problems of lines that were added or modified.

 Have you ever been really impressed with Googles 'Did you mean....' spell checker? Have you ever just typed something into google to help you with your spelling?

 My answer to the above questions above would be Yes, all the time!

 In a fantastic post I read some years ago Peter Norvig outlined how Google’s ‘did you mean’ spelling corrector uses probability theory, large training sets and some elegant statistical language processing to be so effective. Type in a search like 'speling' and Google comes back in 0.1 seconds or so with Did you mean: 'spelling'. Below is a toy spelling corrector in python that achieves 80 to 90% accuracy and is very fast. It's written in a fanstically impressive 21 lines of code. It uses list comprehensions, and some of my favorite data structures (sets and default dictionaries).

 The code and supporting data files can be found in my hacks public repo under the spellcheck folder.

 The data seed comes from a big.txt file that consists of about a million words. The file is a concatenation of several public domain books from Project Gutenberg and lists of most frequent words from Wiktionary and the British National Corpus. It uses a simple training method of just counting the occurrences of each word in the big text file. Obviously Google has a lot more data to seed this spelling checker with but I was suprised at how effective this relatively small seed was.

 <2016-12-22 Thu 11:39>

 This library is already quite usable and some people are already using it in production.

 Nevertheless this library is still under heavy development. The API is still in flux and may be changed quickly without notice.

 This is a pure C library that is designed to have zero dependencies.

 No pathological regexes exist for this regex engine because it does not use a backtracking algorithm at all.

 Already rewrote the code base of Russ Cox's re1 library using the nginx coding style (yes, I love it!), also incorporated a clone of the nginx memory pool into it for memory management.

 Already ported the Thompson and Pike VM backends to sregex. The former is just for yes-or-no matching, and the latter also supports sub-match capturing.

 Implemented the case-insensitive matching mode via the SRE_REGEX_CASELESS flag.

 The full streaming matching API for the sregex engine has already been implemented, for both the Pike and Thompson regex VMs. The sub-match capturing also supports streaming processing. When the state machine is yielded (that is, returning SRE_AGAIN on the current input data chunk), sregex will always output the current value range for the $& sub-match capture in the user-supplied ovector array.

 Almost all the relevant test cases for PCRE 8.32 and Perl 5.16.2 have been imported into sregex's test suite and all tests are passing right now.

 Already implemented an API for assembling multiple user regexes and returning an ID indicating exactly which regex is matched (first), as well as the corresponding sub-match captures.

 There is also a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler targeting x86_64 for the Thompson VM.

 <2016-12-22 Thu 11:40>

 TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.

 The matching algorithm used in TRE uses linear worst-case time in the length of the text being searched, and quadratic worst-case time in the length of the used regular expression.

 In other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(M^2N), where M is the length of the regular expression and N is the length of the text. The used space is also quadratic on the length of the regex, but does not depend on the searched string. This quadratic behaviour occurs only on pathological cases which are probably very rare in practice.

 функционального программирования на примере Python и Haskell. Плюсы и минусы"

 Большей частью внимание уделено Haskell. Поскольку в Haskell нет циклов и
 переменных (переменные эмулируются другими средствами языка), то имеет смысл
 начать с самого начала, то есть с управления состоянием и обхода разного рода
 массивов. По восходящей подберемся к созданию простенького REST приложения на
 обоих языках. Надеюсь, получится отразить как можно больше косяков обоих
 подходов.

 Hakyll is a static site generator written in Haskell. It is more like a library
 than a conventional application, since the configuration is done in Haskell as
 well -- a bit like Xmonad. In this talk, we will give a high-level overview of
 the advantages of static site generators in general and build a quick site
 together. After that, we will dive a bit deeper and examine how semi-automatic
 dependency tracking works in the library.

 If you are bored with your (now old) nexus 7, this is a great way to revive it and make it do new cool (and most importantly useful) things... Nothing from the process of getting it running was particularly difficult, but if you don't have basic knowledge about flashing roms & kernels, don't know what a custom recovery is, etc. - than you should start with tutorials on that, just use google. The same thing applies about using Ubuntu/Linux.

 I encourage you to make questions, I will answer any question which isn't answered in the video or in this description, if it will be important i will also add the answer to this description.

 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Uploaded on Apr 15, 2008
 For a complete lesson on slope of a line, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons with your own personal math teacher! 

 In this lesson, students are asked to find the slope of a line given its graph. To find the slope of a line, students use the formula slope = rise over run. Problems involve lines with positive slopes, negative slopes, slopes that must be reduced, slopes of 0 (horizontal lines), and "no slopes"(vertical lines). Students also learn that the variable "m" is used to represent the slope of a line.

 In Algebra, we use the word "slope" to describe how steep a line is, and the slope of a line can be found using the ratio rise over run between any two points that are on that line.

 Since the slope of a line is a fraction, remember to reduce your slope if possible at the end of the problem.

 The most common mistake made in problems involving the slope of a line is to mess up the sign. To avoid this mistake, we use the following ideas:

 - The slope of a line that is going uphill from left to right is positive.

 - The slope of a line that is going downhill from left to right is negative.

 Note that the slope of a line that is horizontal (flat) is zero, and the slope of a line that is vertical (straight up and down) is 'no slope.'

 The variable "m" is used to represent the slope of a line, so if the slope of a line is 2/3, then we say that m = 2/3.

 The slope of a line is one of the first concepts that is introduced in the study of linear equations.

 SenpaiScript.


 SenpaiScript is a script that will help you determine if your next song is against the rules or if it was played recently.
 

 It is important to note that the script will only have data on versions of the song that have been played.

 That means if a song has many youtube/soundcloud versions, we might not have information on every version, and we might not have all of the versions labeled correctly.

 It's especially important to check your song manually if it says "Unknown".

 Overplayed songs and songs that break the rules can easily have over 30 versions, with new versions being added all the time. It's important to check the overplayed list, check it wasn't played today and to read our rules!

 Еще выяснилось следующее: чтобы открыть деталь в 3D - нужно поместить кнопку "Редактировать В Окне" на панель - из категории "Дополнительно" в настройках интерфейса (вместо категории "Все Команды"). Также есть похожая команда "В окне" в категории "Редактор" - но она не работает для данной задачи.﻿

 ибо еще есть "Редактирование модели в отдельном окне" при вызове этой команды в 3д сборке. и еще не ведомо где оно есть)) и надо найти ту которая отвечает именно за открытие модели из дерева чертежа.﻿

Myth Busting: Fewer distros means better Linux.

UPDATE:
To be perfectly clear, This video has nothing to do with Matthew Moore (I don't pay attention to him, not subscribed or on his G+). I've heard this myth from countless sources over the years and it is not aimed at or about any one specifically. If anything I said in this video matches anyone or appears at a specific point in time as to seem like a rebuke, it is simply a coincidence.

** [[https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc][viewvc/viewvc: ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories.]]
 ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those versions. Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much more prettily than the average textual command-line program output.
 Features

     Support for filesystem-accessible CVS and Subversion repositories.
     Support for path-based authorization, including parsing and honoring Subversion authz configuration files.
     RSS feed generation for tracking changes to repositories or individual items within repositories.
     Individually configurable virtual host support.
     Line-based annotation/blame display.
     Revision graph capabilities (via integration with CvsGraph) (CVS only).
     Syntax highlighting support.
     Bonsai-like repository query facilities.
     Template-driven output generation.
     Colorized, side-by-side differences.
     Tarball generation (by tag/branch for CVS, by revision for Subversion).
     Localization support based on the Accept-Language request header.
     Ability to run either as CGI script or as a standalone server.
     Regexp-based file searching.
     INI-like configuration file (as opposed to requiring actual code tweaks).

 Requirements

 The only hard software requirement for running ViewVC is a suitable version of Python. The specifics of that, as well as all other requirements, depend on what you want to do with the tool. As those have changed somewhat over the years, it's best to consult the INSTALL file of the specific ViewVC release you wish to evaluate for its exact requirements. Here are pointers to the INSTALL files for the current major release lines:

     ViewVC 1.1.x
     Unreleased bleeding edge (1.2-dev)

** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/][The GNU C Library]]
 What is glibc?

 The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

 The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible, portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008.

 The project was started circa 1988 and is almost 30 years old. You can see the complete project release history on the wiki.

 Despite the project's age there is still a lot to do so please Get Started and Get Involved!
 Current Status

 The GNU C Library releases every 6 months. See the NEWS file in the glibc sources for more information.

     The current stable version of glibc is 2.24, released on August 5, 2016.
     The current development version of glibc 2.25, releasing on or around February 1, 2017.

 Many packages could be listed in any of several categories, but for the table here just one has to be chosen, usually following the Free Software Directory.
** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/][The GNU C Reference Manual - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation]]
  The GNU C Reference Manual is a reference for the C programming language, as implemented by the GNU C Compiler.

 This manual is strictly a reference, not a tutorial. Its aim is to cover every linguistic construct in GNU C, but not the library functions (which are documented elsewhere). This manual would probably not make a good introductory book for new programmers, although those who know languages other than C should be able to learn C using it.

 The v0.2.5 release of the manual is now available, which includes a number of corrections suggested by readers. If you don't feel like building the manual from the Texinfo source, you can also read an HTML version or PDF version of the manual.

 For additional information, please see the manual's project page at Savannah.

 There are some problems with CTF write-ups in general:

     they’re scattered across the interwebs
     they don’t usually include the original files needed to solve the challenge
     some of them are incomplete or skip ‘obvious’ parts of the explanation, and are therefore not as helpful for newcomers
     often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

 This repository aims to solve those problems.

 It’s a collection of CTF source files and write-ups that anyone can contribute to. Did you just publish a CTF write-up? Let us know, and we’ll add a link to your post — or just add the link yourself and submit a pull request. Spot an issue with a solution? Correct it, and send a pull request.

 If you want to use FeedBurner for your feed, you will likely need to decide upon a unique identifier. For example, if your site were called “Thyme” and hosted on the www.example.com domain, you might use “thymefeeds” as your unique identifier, which we’ll use throughout this section for illustrative purposes. In your Pelican settings, set the FEED_ATOM attribute to thymefeeds/main.xml to create an Atom feed with an original address of http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml. Set the FEED_DOMAIN attribute to http://feeds.feedburner.com, or http://feeds.example.com if you are using a CNAME on your own domain (i.e., FeedBurner’s “MyBrand” feature).

 There are two fields to configure in the FeedBurner interface: “Original Feed” and “Feed Address”. In this example, the “Original Feed” would be http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml and the “Feed Address” suffix would be thymefeeds/main.xml.

 git-remote-dropbox is a transparent bidirectional bridge between Git and Dropbox. It lets you use a Dropbox folder or a shared folder as a Git remote!

 This Git remote helper makes Dropbox act like a true Git remote. It maintains all guarantees that are provided by a traditional Git remote while using Dropbox as a backing store. This means that it works correctly even when there are multiple people operating on the repository at once, making it possible to use a Dropbox shared folder as a Git remote for collaboration.

 Once the helper is installed, using it is as simple as adding a remote like dropbox://path/to/repo.

 Well, as I see it, with all the great usefulness of Linux, its biggest drawback is with its mixed up way of installing apps. All the dlls go to one directory. All the configuration files to another. And the binaries are also put in a bunch. Yes, Windows works the same way more or less, but with the nature of system/server software installed on Linux, being that most of the software installed is only about 95% mature at any given time, messing up your system twice a month is very probable..

 Анастасия, сразу как правило не отчисляют, дают возможность сдать долги, если ты этой возможностью не воспользуешься , тогда да. Имеет смысл сходить в деканат и уточнить этот вопрос не затягивая. Обязательно в конце сессии проверьте в деканате, все ли у вас закрыто по бумагам, иначе в начале следующей сессии, можно сразу нарваться на недопуск, а это лишняя беготня.

  I am going to use Jupyter notebooks to teach from this semester. I really dislike preparing notebooks though. A browser is a really poor editor, and I really dislike Markdown. Notebooks do not seem to have any real structure in them, e.g. the collapsible outline that I am used to in org-mode, so for long notebooks, it is difficult to get a sense for the structure. I am anticipating spending up to 80 hours preparing notebooks this semester, so today I worked out some code to export org-mode to an ipython notebook!

 systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit. Other parts include a logging daemon, utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users and running containers and virtual machines, system accounts, runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name resolution. See Lennart's blog story for a longer introduction, and the three status updates since then. Also see the Wikipedia article. If you are wondering whether systemd is for you, please have a look at this comparison of init systems by one of the creators of systemd.

 Да. Но если жизнь заставляет сидеть там существенно больше, чем полчаса, есть смысл не воротить нос, а прибрать и помыть руки. Где-то так для начала: Autohotkey, dexpot, nircmd, revouninstaller, unlocker, clipx, KatMouse, kdemouse, Procmon, procexp, ImgBurn, imdisk, двухпанельный ФМ (DC, к примеру), SumatraPDF. Для Win7 и выше также ClassicShell, VisualBcd. По вкусу можно добавить keyla, strokesplus, nncron, XMOUSE2000 (до W2k) или x-mouse_controls (для w7 и выше). Ну и ещё много чего настроить штатными средствами (иногда по локоть в реестре).
 Это я к тому, что те, кто не понимают кайфа ходить строем, и готовы потратить время на сборку действительно удобной среды, под Windows это тоже могут сделать.

 luastatus is a universal status bar content generator. It allows you to configure the way the data from plugins is processed and shown with Lua.

 Its main feature is that the content can be updated immediately as some event occurs, be it a change of keyboard layout, active window title, volume or a song in your favourite player (if there is a plugin for it, of course) — a thing rather uncommon for tiling window managers.

нитку в счет не берем, так как от нее происходит отсчет и она является
нулевой.

Вычисления производится по формуле. Длину ниток нужно разделить на
количество ниток и в итоге получается шаг.

 Необходимо выполнить 2 контрольные работы: №1 и №2 (см. стр. 45 и
 60). 

 Номер варианта - последние 2 цифры номера зачётки (если они больше
 20, от сначала отнять 20, например, если 29, то вариант 9). Работы
 сдать в двух отдельных тетрадках. Решение оформлять по всем правилам,
 с "дано" и т. п., нарисовать большие, аккуратные рисунки, желательны
 комментарии. Сначала нужно вывести формулу с буквами, и только на
 последнем этапе подставить конкретные числа.  Сдать работы в
 ауд. 3111 в первые 2 дня сессии. В случае просрочки может дать другой
 вариант. Возможно, на экзамене будет просить пояснить решение своих
 контрольных.

 Преподаватель Ходьков Дмитрий Афанасьевич.

 В сессию будут 4 лекции и 4 лабораторных. Лабораторные - с особой
 формой отчёта, написанного от руки, причем приходить на саму
 лабораторную нужно уже с заготовкой и в конце что-то подписать у
 пр-ля. Более подробно - в приложенной методичке и на сайте
 physicsleti.ru Темы для изучения по семестрам в принципе тоже есть в
 методичке. Сказал, что в течение семестра нужно хорошо всё изучить,

 Собеседование - это ваше первое достижение на пути трудоустройства. Тот факт, что вас пригласили на собеседование, уже говорит о том, что ваше резюме было выделено среди остальных. Теперь вам необходимо произвести на собеседовании положительное впечатление, которое уже заочно о вас сложилось на основе вашего резюме. Вот несколько советов на примере типичных ошибок на собеседовании, которые часто допускают кандидаты. Особенно часто эти ошибки допускают молодые или начинающие кандидаты, у которых мало опыта. Но, увы, и опытные кандидаты и даже соискатели в солидном возрасте тоже допускают подобные ошибки, хотя, наверное, несколько реже, чем новички. В любом случае, даже если вы считаете себя опытным кандидатом, посмотрите на приведенные типичные ошибки на собеседовании, чтобы убедиться, что вы их точно не допустите.

 Kali Linux “Live” has two options in the default boot menu which enable persistence — the preservation of data on the “Kali Live” USB drive — across reboots of “Kali Live”. This can be an extremely useful enhancement, and enables you to retain documents, collected testing results, configurations, etc., when running Kali Linux “Live” from the USB drive, even across different systems. The persistent data is stored in its own partition on the USB drive, which can also be optionally LUKS-encrypted.

 This Reddit conversation shows how hard it may be to automatically grab the latest version of built-in packages, like org. In most cases, (use-package) or other managers won't install the package if it's already available. Users have to resort to strange workarounds to get this done (or, like myself, have it working and have no idea how)

 Melpa could provide a solution for this problem if it carried a virtual package, like org-virtual, without any contents but with a dependency on the latest version of org. I can create and maintain such a package and contribute it to Melpa.

 Would you accept to provide such a package in your repository?

 If you’re happy with what you’re using, you shouldn’t. (If it ain’t broke…) BUT, if you are interested in trying something new, here are some things you should know:

     erc-hl-nicks is based on erc-highlight-nicknames, so it will auto colorize nicknames (you don’t have to specify colors)
     erc-hl-nicks will ignore certain characters that IRC clients add to nicknames to avoid duplicates (nickname, nickname’, nickname”, etc.)
     erc-hl-nicks can attempt to produce colors with a sufficient amount of contrast between the nick color and the background color.

 NetHack 3.6 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack.
 It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of
 NetHack 3.4. In order to avoid confusion with interim development code 
 that was posted online in 2014 by others, there is no NetHack 3.5 release.

 NetHack 3.6.1 contains several dozen bugfixes.

 The text in there was written for the development team's own use and is 
 provided "as is", so please do not ask us to further explain the entries

 in the "new features" section.

 Here are some additional general notes that are not considered spoilers:
  * Some code paths and long-established game features have been made 
    part of the base build and no longer conditional on compile settings.
  * Several treasured NetHack community patches, or a variation of 
    them, have been rolled in to the base NetHack source tree, incuding: 
    menucolors, pickup thrown, statue glyphs, dungeon overview, sortloot.

 Setting up System with LUKS + LVM + BTRFS

 The manual steps for setting up the system are detailed in the part1 blog post from Fedora 22. This time around I have created a script that will quickly configure the system with LUKS + LVM + BTRFS. The script will need to be run in an Anaconda environment just like the manual steps were done in part1 last time.

 You can easily enable ssh access to your Anaconda booted machine by adding inst.sshd to the kernel command line arguments. After booting up you can scp the script over and then execute it to build the system. Please read over the script and modify it to your liking.

 Alternatively, for an automated install I have embedded that same script into a kickstart file that you can use. The kickstart file doesn't really leverage Anaconda at all because it simply runs a %pre script and then reboots the box. It's basically like just telling Anaconda to run a bash script, but allows you to do it in an automated way. None of the kickstart directives at the top of the kickstart file actually get used.

Why can't I put the panel vertically on the left or right of the display? Gnome-shell and it's numerous extensions add widgets to the panel. These widgets have been designed using padding and absolute positioning assuming a horizontal layout. At this point in time, I don't think it is possible to allow for a vertical layout and still maintain any sort of reasonable compatibility with many of the other features of Gnome.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Welcome to the USB Video Class Linux device driver home.

The goal of this project is to provide all necessary software components to fully support UVC compliant devices in Linux. This include a V4L2 kernel device driver and patches for user-space tools.

The USB Device Class Definition for Video Devices, or USB Video Class, defines video streaming functionality on the Universal Serial Bus. Much like nearly all mass storage devices (USB flash disks, external SATA disk enclosures, ...) can be managed by a single driver because they conform to the USB Mass Storage specification, UVC compliant peripherals only need a generic driver.

The UVC specification covers webcams, digital camcorders, analog video converters, analog and digital television tuners, and still-image cameras that support video streaming for both video input and output.

Due to the limited available man power and the broad scope of the UVC specification, the Linux UVC project will concentrate the development efforts on video input devices, especially webcams. Video output devices are supported in bulk mode only.

First, let’s talk about toolsets. While there are many different options, the majority of static site generators fall into three categories (with a fourth coming up strong): JavaScript, Ruby, and Python-based offerings. The popularity of React means there are a handful of newer options built around it, and those will only grow in number. That’s in addition to outliers like Hugo, which is built with Google’s Go language. While you may be familiar with all the offerings, you no doubt have one that you prefer, so that narrows the field straight off the bat.

Then it’s time to decide what kind of project you are launching. Do you want to create a blog? Well, my friend, you should check out Jekyll, Hexo or Pelican. Setting up your portfolio? Try out Expose or Cactus. Need to set up a highly polished corporate or marketing site? Creative agencies love Middleman and Roots. Gatsby and Phenomic, both built with React, give you blogs that function like single page apps. Speaking of single page apps, build one with Metalsmith or Assemble.

There’s no need to be overwhelmed by the possibilities, and if you are, staticgen.com–a leaderboard of top static web generators–can help you figure out the best tool for your project.

Control physical access to a linux computer by locking all of its virtual terminals / consoles.

physlock is an alternative to vlock, it is equivalent to `vlock -an'. It is written because vlock blocks some linux kernel mechanisms like hibernate and suspend and can therefore only be used with some limitations. physlock is designed to be more lightweight, it does not have a plugin interface and it is not started using a shell script wrapper.

physlock tries to detect the user logged in on the active console by first searching the utmp file for an entry whose ut_line field equals the device name of the active console, e.g. "tty1". If no such entry is found, then physlock falls back to the owner of the device file of the active console. Some graphical login managers do neither write an appropriate utmp entry nor set the owner of the device file. You have to manually set up sessreg(1) in order to use physlock with such a graphical login manager.

In particular, I have not done a great job tracking requirements, and documentation, to put it euphamistically, almost exclusively takes the form of naming conventions.

My own reasons for building this tool and using it for videos are twofold, and I'm not sure how well they apply to other people's use cases.

 Recently I've been quite obsessed with Make. I think it might be the perfect tool to deal with complex software projects that consist of many different systems that are build using various languages (my team at issuu uses it to the build, test, & deploy our frontend, backend and various internal tools). However, I'll save that rant for another blog post but given my fascination with Make I recently set out to write a Makefile for this blog.

 <2016-12-15 Thu 09:11>



 Kakoune is a code editor heavily inspired by Vim, as such most of its commands are similar to vi’s ones, and it shares Vi’s "keystrokes as a text editing language" model.

 Kakoune can operate in two modes, normal and insertion. In insertion mode, keys are directly inserted into the current buffer. In normal mode, keys are used to manipulate the current selection and to enter insertion mode.

 Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most commands provide immediate and incremental results, while still being competitive (as in keystroke count) with Vim.

 Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of characters, selections have an anchor and a cursor character. Most commands move both of them, except when extending selection where the anchor character stays fixed and the cursor one moves around.

 The goals of ShellCheck are

     To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues that cause a shell to give cryptic error messages.

     To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems that cause a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.

     To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls that may cause an advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.

 See the gallery of bad code for examples of what ShellCheck can help you identify!

 Convert Any Input to Parsed Date or Datetime
 Motivation

 R excels at computing with dates, and times. Using typed representation for your data is highly recommended not only because of the functionality offered but also because of the added safety stemming from proper representation.

 But there is a small nuisance cost in interactive work as well as in programming. Users must have told as.POSIXct() about a million times that the origin is (of course) the epoch. Do we really have to say it a million more times? Similarly, when parsing dates that are some recogniseable form of YYYYMMDD format, do we really have to manually convert from integer or numeric or factor or ordered to character first? Having one of several common separators and/or date / time month forms (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY/MM/DD, YYYYMMDD, YYYY-mon-DD and so on, with or without times), do we really need a format string?

 Or could a smart converter function do this? anytime() aims to be that general purpose converter returning a proper POSIXct (or Date) object nomatter the input (provided it was somewhat parseable), relying on Boost date_time for the (efficient, performant) conversion.

 Language Support

 By default, evalator uses Elisp as its evaluation language, but it supports other languages through extension packages. These packages define an evaluation context that can be passed to the evalator command in order to set the evaluation language for that particular session.
 Currently available evaluation contexts

     Clojure - via evalator-clojure

 Don't see a context package for your favorite language? Write one! See evalator-elisp.el and evalator-clojure.el for examples. Open an issue in this repo with any questions and I'll be happy to help.

 Here's a practical example to demonstrate what evalator's capable of:

 How to push a git repo to multiple remote repositories, such as GitLab & BitBucket, with a single command.
 Background

 I’ve been using BitBucket, which offers unlimited private repositories for free, to backup my git repos in the cloud.

 Recently I switched to GitLab. They offer a similar service, also for free, but with a nicer UI. In particular, GitLab can search inside files, not just the filenames. This feature is curiously missing from BitBucket, although it was logged back in 2011.

 Unfortunately, GitLab’s shiny UI baulks when confronted with my notes repository: a single folder containing several hundred markdown files. BitBucket, meanwhile, handles it without a hitch.

 I wanted to keep both repos updated so that I can use whichever service is more useful for a given task. Having redundant copies of my files also offers some peace of mind.

As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support and should cope with arbitrary files including: large, binary or single-line ones.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
While dnf doesn't offer changelog display inline with the update
process (via a --changelog argument, as yum-plugin-changelog
provided), a fedoraforum user pointed out that dnf updateinfo info
will display the text of update advisory notices, which covers most of
the former yum --changelog upgrade output.

You don't get the detailed changelogs for packages that don't use
update advisories, but it's at least a workable substitute. You can
also use dnf updateinfo list to get a short listing of advisories, and
a simple dnf updateinfo will produce a brief summary with counts of
the outstanding update advisories.

Note that because dnf updateinfo doesn't refresh metadata by default,
the most equivalent command to yum --changelog upgrade is probably
something like dnf --refresh updateinfo info; dnf upgrade.

The workflow is a bit convoluted, but it works with most gifs:

1. take the screencast with the gnome shell screencasting feature (results in a webm)
2. convert the webm to a sequence of images with this gstreamer command:
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location="input.webm" ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! pngenc ! multifilesink location="pngs/%04d.png"
3. convert the pngs to a gif with this imagemagick command:
convert *.png animation.gif
4. crunch the gif with:
convert animation.gif -fuzz 5% -layers Optimize animation-optimized.gif
This step is a bit of trial and error. you mess with the fuzz % value to get a gif that is a good size yet looks ok.

5. If you want to crunch it even more, you can convert your animation to an indexed gif (specifying the number of colours — i chose 64 in this example)
convert animation-optimized.gif -dither FloydSteinberg -colors 64 animation-optimized-indexed.gif

Its all about trial and error to see which looks the best (yet keeping the size as small as possible 🙂 )

Newsstar fetches news and posts it to a local server; INN, s-news and sn are supported, and it should be easy to adapt for other servers with some configuration and extra scripts. It's designed for Unix-like systems, and all the development was done on Linux.

There are already plenty of other programs to do this, but what makes newsstar special is that it can make multiple simultaneous connections, not only to one server, but to several, supporting up to 10 threads. Before fetching each article it checks that it hasn't already been downloaded by another thread or in a previous session. It can also pipeline article requests to make better use of available bandwidth.

I wrote it because a number of ISPs I have used suffer from unreliable newsfeeds. There is an excellent free server made available by news.individual.net, but it can be a bit slow at times, and using external servers uses more bandwidth. Therefore I wanted a program which could fetch whatever articles my ISP has available, but use the foreign server to avoid missing posts or getting them very late, and to do it as fast as possible.

Newsstar is distributed under the GPL. If you are reading this file offline you should have a file called COPYING with details. Due to a long-term illness I am unable to earn a living, either by programming or by any other means, so any gifts will be much appreciated. You can use the Sourceforge/Paypal donation scheme or see below to find out where to send cheques or cash etc.

I usually refrain myself from writing anything in the style of "How to setup foo", for it's quite silly, but my recent adventures in gmane forced me to break my rule for there is practically 0 info about the inn+newsstar "stack".

The setup is:

    Fedora 24.
    We create newsgroup gmane.test in an INN installed on a localhost (this INN is lonely & isn't connected to any other NNTP servers out there).
    We use newsstar (grab the .spec file from here) to connect to news.gmane.org machine, download articles from remote gmane.test group & post them to local gmane.test newsgroup.
    We use our favourite newsreader (Mutt + nntp patch) to read local gmane.test newsgroup.
    We post our message to local gmane.test newsgroup. Then we run newsstar again & it uses INN's spool of messages prepared to be sent away. newsstar grabs our message, connects to news.gmane.org machine & posts it.

The radeon driver has supported DRI3 and Present since version 7.6.0, but it doesn't appear to be enabled by default. You could try turning it on in an xorg.conf.d snippet as the Arch wiki describes.

You could also try the new "TearFree" option, but to the best of my knowledge, it shouldn't be necessary with DRI3/Present.

While dnf doesn't offer changelog display inline with the update process (via a --changelog argument, as yum-plugin-changelog provided), a fedoraforum user pointed out that dnf updateinfo info will display the text of update advisory notices, which covers most of the former yum --changelog upgrade output.

You don't get the detailed changelogs for packages that don't use update advisories, but it's at least a workable substitute. You can also use dnf updateinfo list to get a short listing of advisories, and a simple dnf updateinfo will produce a brief summary with counts of the outstanding update advisories.

Note that because dnf updateinfo doesn't refresh metadata by default, the most equivalent command to yum --changelog upgrade is probably something like dnf --refresh updateinfo info; dnf upgrade.

I'm sure you've encountered your share of "How do I transform X to Y?"-type questions on the web. I know I have. A lot of answers involve using kitchen-sink tools like ffmpeg or convert. These tools are great: they can transform almost anything into anything else. But they come with a price of a gazillion switches that are hard to remember (and to type in, for that matter).

This package solves this problem by moving the complex command to a Makefile with customizable literate parameters at the top. Additionally it catalogs all available Makefiles by the file extension that they work on. It also creates a Makefile template for you when a selected action doesn't exist.
Advantages

    You write the command only once. All the other times, you just customize the literate switches.

    It's possible to not have to write the command at all if it's available in the repository.

    Since the command is meant to be written just once, you can have a more complex and optimized command, compared to the one that you would normally enter in the terminal.

    In case of multiple files, make allows to use multiple cores without the actual command knowing about it. This means that people with different processors can use the same Makefile to the most efficiency, calling make -j8 or make -j2 where appropriate.

    The Elisp layer of this package solves the problem of Makefiles and file names with spaces.

** [2017-03-28 Tue 19:28] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_same-page_merging][Kernel same-page merging - Wikipedia]]
In computing, kernel same-page merging (abbreviated as KSM, and also known as kernel shared memory and memory merging) is a kernel feature that makes it possible for a hypervisor system to share identical memory pages amongst different processes or virtualized guests. While not directly linked, Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) can use KSM to merge memory pages occupied by virtual machines.

KSM performs the memory sharing by scanning through the main memory and finding duplicate pages. Each detected duplicate pair is then merged into a single page, and mapped into both original locations. The page is also marked as "copy-on-write" (COW), so the kernel will automatically separate them again should one process modify its data.[1]

KSM was originally intended to run more virtual machines on one host by sharing memory between processes as well as virtual machines. Upon its implementation, different users found KSM to also be useful for non-virtualized environments in which memory is at a premium.[2][3] An experimental implementation of KSM by Red Hat found that 52 virtual instances of Windows XP with 1 GB of memory, could run on a host computer that had only 16 GB of RAM.[4]

KSM was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.32, which was released on December 3, 2009.[2][4] To be effective, the operating system kernel must find identical memory pages held by different processes. The kernel also needs to decide whether the pages are going to update infrequently enough that the merging would be an efficient use of processor resources.[3] A concern is that although memory usage is reduced, CPU usage is increased, thus negating potential increases in performance.[1]

 И тут приходит UKSM:

    Сканирует память сам. Разработчикам не нужно править исходники.
    Не тратит CPU зря. UKSM автоматически определяет несовмещенные страницы, основываясь на истории случайных выборок. Пространству с большим количеством известных несовмещенных страниц дается вся скорость, в то время как пространству с низким количеством совмещаемых страниц отдается низкий приоритет, практически не расходуя циклы процессора.
    Очень высокая скорость работы. Для этого используется новый алгоритм хэширования. Обычно, чтобы отличить страницы одну от другой, достаточно прохэшировать только ее часть. В лучшем случае, алгоритму достаточно прохэшировать только одно 32-битное слово, а не всю страницу, а в худшем, его скорость сравнима с SuperFastHash. Скорость поиска страниц: 627 — 2445 МБ/с, а скорость совмещения: 477 — 923 МБ/с. Также, не тратится CPU и в зонах трешинга, что дает значительно меньшее использование процессорного времени взамен немного худшей экономии памяти.



Какой выигрыш можно получить?
На моем десктопе, потребляемая память сократилась на 50-100МБ. В идеале, 10 одинаковых виртуалок будут потреблять оперативную память, как одна.

About the network bandwidth: If the issue here is that you are on a network with other devices and you don't want to take all the bandwidth (soho network), there are tools like "Wondershaper" which can be used to limit the bandwidth on your NIC.For example lets assume that your ISP provide you with 10Mbps download/1Mbps upload and you want to limit this to 1/3 for your system, then:

sudo dnf install wondershaper
sudo wondershaper enp2s0 300 3000

This actually means: apply bandwidth limit to eth0 30Kbps upload/300Kbps download

And with

sudo wondershaper clear enp2s0

You lift the bandwidth limit.

About the downloads and the security: it's preferable to use

sudo dnf update

It will check for updates from the enabled repositories on your system, list them, and prompt if you want to continue with instalment or not. You can choose to install them all, or install specific ones, or even before do that to check each package with

dnf info <package>
rpm -qi <package>

Also remember that dnf has built in gpg key verification.

systemd-journal-remote — Receive journal messages over the network
Synopsis

systemd-journal-remote [OPTIONS...] [-o/--output=DIR|FILE] [SOURCES...]
Description

systemd-journal-remote is a command to receive serialized journal events and store them to the journal. Input streams are in the Journal Export Format , i.e. like the output from journalctl --output=export. For transport over the network, this serialized stream is usually carried over an HTTPS connection.
Sources

Sources can be either "active" (systemd-journal-remote requests and pulls the data), or "passive" (systemd-journal-remote waits for a connection and then receives events pushed by the other side).

systemd-journal-remote can read more than one event stream at a time. They will be interleaved in the output file. In case of "active" connections, each "source" is one stream, and in case of "passive" connections, each connection can result in a separate stream. Sockets can be configured in "accept" mode (i.e. only one connection), or "listen" mode (i.e. multiple connections, each resulting in a stream).

When there are no more connections, and no more can be created (there are no listening sockets), then systemd-journal-remote will exit.

This is a distributed implementation of the algorithm described in Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning (Tim Salimans, Jonathan Ho, Xi Chen, Ilya Sutskever).

The implementation here uses a master-worker architecture: at each iteration, the master broadcasts parameters to the workers, and the workers send returns back to the master. The humanoid scaling experiment in the paper was generated with an implementation similar to this one.

The code here runs on EC2, so you need an AWS account. It's resilient to worker termination, so it's safe to run the workers on spot instances.

FAME is a recursive acronym meaning “FAME Automates Malware Evaluation”.

It is meant to facilitate analysis of malicious files, leveraging as much knowledge as possible in order to speed up and automate end-to-end analysis.

Best case scenario: the analyst drops a sample, waits for a few minutes, and FAME is able to determine the malware family and extract its configuration and IOCs.

FAME should be seen as a framework that will empower your malware analysis development efforts.

You can get more information (and screenshots !) on the website and in the documentation.

 The semanage fcontext command is used to change the SELinux context of files. When using targeted policy, changes are written to files located in the /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/ directory:

    The file_contexts file specifies default contexts for many files, as well as contexts updated via semanage fcontext.
    The file_contexts.local file stores contexts to newly created files and directories not found in file_contexts. 

Two utilities read these files. The setfiles utility is used when a file system is relabeled and the restorecon utility restores the default SELinux contexts. This means that changes made by semanage fcontext are persistent, even if the file system is relabeled. SELinux policy controls whether users are able to modify the SELinux context for any given file.

It supports the CQWW, the WPX, the ARRL-DX , the ARRL-FD, the PACC and the 
EU SPRINT contests (single operator) as well as a LOT MORE basic contests, 
general QSO and DXpedition mode. 

It interfaces with a morse code generator, your sound card, a number of radios,
and with a DX Cluster. 

Tlf can project cluster data into the excellent Xplanet program, written by 
Hari Nair.

Contest operation mimics the popular TR-Log program for DOS, the output file 
is TR- as well as CABRILLO compatible. The user interface was designed with 
over 30 years of experience in CW contesting. 

The program was written for console mode on purpose, to make it run also on 
smaller machines, or remotely via a modem link.

Fedora has stable releases, archive releases, really old archive releases, 'milestone' releases (Alpha / Beta), release validation testing composes (TCs and RCs), unstable nightly composes, and post-release nightly composes, all in different places, with several different layouts. There is no canonical database of the locations and contents of all the various composes/releases. We in Fedora QA found we had several tools that needed to know where to find various images from various different types of releases, and little bits of knowledge about the locations and layouts of various releases/composes had been added to different tools. fedfind was written to consolidate all this esoteric knowledge in a single codebase with a consistent interface.

fedfind lets you specify a release/compose using four values: 'release', 'milestone', 'compose', and 'respin'. It can then find the location for that compose, tell you whether it exists, and give you the locations of all the images that are part of the release and what each image actually contains. As an alternative to this versioning concept, you can also find releases by their Pungi 4 / productmd 'compose ID' or 'compose label' (see examples above).

Prerequisites

This document assumes you've already installed all the components you need. If you haven't, see Installation Guide.

The next steps are:

    Configure your webserver (Apache, nginx, or lighttpd).
    Access Phabricator with your browser.
    Follow the instructions to complete setup.

Webserver: Configuring Apache
NOTE: Follow these instructions to use Apache. To use nginx or lighttpd, scroll down to their sections.

Get Apache running and verify it's serving a test page. Consult the Apache documentation for help. Make sure mod_php and mod_rewrite are enabled, and mod_ssl if you intend to set up SSL.

If you haven't already, set up a domain name to point to the host you're installing on. You can either install Phabricator on a subdomain (like phabricator.example.com) or an entire domain, but you can not install it in some subdirectory of an existing website. Navigate to whatever domain you're going to use and make sure Apache serves you something to verify that DNS is correctly configured.
** [2017-03-30 Thu 14:16] [[https://docker-autotest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][1   Docker Autotest 0.8.6 — Docker Autotest Documentation]]
Docker Autotest is a sub-framework for standalone testing of docker. It does not depend on docker itself. Functionally, testing occurs within any number of subtest modules, which in some cases also include further nested sub-subtests. It is designed to support both extremely simple, linear, and more complex, nested, iterative testing of arbitrary external docker commands.

Test content and configuration is fully modular, supporting both included and external tests. The included content is primarily focused on continuous-integration testing of the Docker CLI client, with a very limited amount of negative and stress testing.

As with other Autotest Client Tests the main entry point is the test control file. Docker Autotest’s control file utilizes Autotest’s steps-engine. This allows the overall testing state to be stored, recovered, and resumed should a host-kernel panic or if userspace become unresponsive. Consequently, rebooting the host system as a testing step is also supported.
** [2017-03-30 Thu 14:17] [[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Taskotron/Tasks/upgradepath][Taskotron/Tasks/upgradepath - FedoraProject]]
Upgradepath is a constraint that ensures the ability to upgrade from Fedora release N to Fedora release N+1.

In other words no package dependencies may break when the user wants to upgrade his/her Fedora. That is achieved by requiring the higher Fedora release to contain at least the same or higher package build versions (in N-V-R sense) than the lower Fedora release.

Taskotron executes this test for any update that is proposed in Bodhi and reports the result to resultsDB.

Built in to Twitter, no. There are several services that will facilitate this for you.

The most popular seems to be Tweetymail. TwitterMail is another. Twitdom may have some more in their "email" tag.

For what it's worth, Tweet to Email does the opposite. It lets you send your Tweets to your non-Twitter using friends.

Martin Fowler, who first wrote about Continuous Integration (short: CI) together with Kent Beck, describes the CI as follows:

    Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.

A simple yet functional desktop recorder for Linux systems. Built using Python, GTK+ 3 and ffmpeg. It supports recording audio and video on almost all Linux interfaces. Also, Green Recorder is the first desktop program to support Wayland display server on GNOME session.

The following formats are currently supported: mkv, avi, mp4, wmv and nut (And only WebM for Wayland's GNOME session). You can stop the recording process easily by right-clicking the icon and choosing "Stop Record". Or middle-clicking the recording icon in the notifications area (but doesn't work on all interfaces).

Green recorder uses the default audio device you have to record. So if you want to change the audio input source, you just need to change it from the system-side (using pavucontrol for example).

By default, On Wayland only, Green Recorder uses the V8 encoder instead of the default V9 encoder in GNOME Shell because of the CPU & RAM consumption issue with V9. Which - now - should also give you better performance. On Xorg, each format uses its own default encoder.

This is a recording sample for DOTA 2 running on Wayland: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwCRBoOdJzU

simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible JSON <http://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+ and Python 3.3+. It is pure Python code with no dependencies, but includes an optional C extension for a serious speed boost.

The latest documentation for simplejson can be read online here: https://simplejson.readthedocs.io/

simplejson is the externally maintained development version of the json library included with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, but maintains backwards compatibility with Python 2.5.

The encoder can be specialized to provide serialization in any kind of situation, without any special support by the objects to be serialized (somewhat like pickle). This is best done with the default kwarg to dumps.

The decoder can handle incoming JSON strings of any specified encoding (UTF-8 by default). It can also be specialized to post-process JSON objects with the object_hook or object_pairs_hook kwargs. This is particularly useful for implementing protocols such as JSON-RPC that have a richer type system than JSON itself.

For those of you that have legacy systems to maintain, there is a very old fork of simplejson in the python2.2 branch that supports Python 2.2. This is based off of a very old version of simplejson, is not maintained, and should only be used as a last resort.

cotools is a collection of functional programming primitives that make use of the cooperative multitasking facilities found in Twisted.

The goal is to provide a more comfortable mechanism for breaking up and cooperatively scheduling computation than those discussed in my talk Cooperative Multitasking with Twisted (video) where I discuss how to break up and schedule work using reactor.callLater and twisted.internet.task.coiterate. The primitives provided by cotools utilize twisted.internet.task.coiterate and also attempt to be fully Deferred aware. Meaning that Deferreds are valid values as iterators, in iterators, and as return values of the functions to be applied to the items in the iterators.

I admit that these examples are rather contrived and the implementation though having significant test coverage may not be optimal or performant. My goal is more to facilitate discussion about how to make Cooperative Multitasking a more comfortable programming paradigm and to attempt to give novice Twisted users some level of cooperation 'for free'.

    That said, a determined user with an account can very likely access or change files of other users in the same container! Use this for personal use, behind a firewall, or with an account creation token, so that only other people you trust create accounts. Don't make one of these publicly available with important data in it and no account creation token!

The Imenu facility offers a way to find the major definitions in a file by name. It is also useful in text formatter major modes, where it treats each chapter, section, etc., as a definition. (See Xref, for a more powerful feature that handles multiple files together.)

If you type M-x imenu, it reads the name of a definition using the minibuffer, then moves point to that definition. You can use completion to specify the name; the command always displays the whole list of valid names.

Alternatively, you can bind the command imenu to a mouse click. Then it displays mouse menus for you to select a definition name. You can also add the buffer’s index to the menu bar by calling imenu-add-menubar-index. If you want to have this menu bar item available for all buffers in a certain major mode, you can do this by adding imenu-add-menubar-index to its mode hook. But if you have done that, you will have to wait a little while each time you visit a file in that mode, while Emacs finds all the definitions in that buffer.

When you change the contents of a buffer, if you add or delete definitions, you can update the buffer’s index based on the new contents by invoking the ‘*Rescan*’ item in the menu. Rescanning happens automatically if you set imenu-auto-rescan to a non-nil value. There is no need to rescan because of small changes in the text.

You can customize the way the menus are sorted by setting the variable imenu-sort-function. By default, names are ordered as they occur in the buffer; if you want alphabetic sorting, use the symbol imenu--sort-by-name as the value. You can also define your own comparison function by writing Lisp code.

Imenu provides the information to guide Which Function mode (see Which Function). The Speedbar can also use it (see Speedbar).

Hideshow mode is a buffer-local minor mode that allows you to selectively display portions of a program, which are referred to as blocks. Type M-x hs-minor-mode to toggle this minor mode (see Minor Modes).

When you use Hideshow mode to hide a block, the block disappears from the screen, to be replaced by an ellipsis (three periods in a row). Just what constitutes a block depends on the major mode. In C mode and related modes, blocks are delimited by braces, while in Lisp mode they are delimited by parentheses. Multi-line comments also count as blocks.

The hi-lock suggestions are good. I think it's easier to use the M-x versions, though:

M-x highlight-regexp RET <REGEXP>

M-x highlight-phrase RET <REGEXP>

highlight-phrase is just a bit of sugar around highlight-regexp that ignores case and translates a space in the regex to match arbitrary whitespace. Handy.
** [2017-04-04 Tue 21:46] [[https://github.com/TurningWheel/Barony][TurningWheel/Barony: Barony Open Source Release]]
Well here it is, as promised: the open source release of Barony. Keep in mind you still need a purchased copy of Barony to play this. I'd recommend that you thumb through all of the included text files to get a feeling of other things you'll need to build the game and check out the included licenses as well.

Many thanks go to Ciprian Ilies for his original contributions to the game code, as well as for the build systems, config files, and support libraries that he developed for the project over the years. In the future, he plans to head up development on some new stuff for Barony, so keep an eye out for that.

This project was a first for both of us in many ways and it shows. Since all of the original code was written in C and hastily converted to C++ in the past few months, experienced C++ programmers may be horrified at some of the kludge we had to write to get some of the more basic systems working properly. There's not a lot of module organization either since I didn't understand how to properly write projects that scale when I started the code three years ago. Prepare to deal with lots of global variables that get used all over the project indiscriminately.

Despite the project's shortcomings, I'm reasonably proud of how the end product turned out. Writing good games is about more than just writing good code, though I guarantee we'll be taking all of the lessons learned from Barony into our next project.

I'm not sure how many people will be interested in working on this, and it may take a while for anything substantial to get going here, but I'd be pleased to see some coordinated efforts take place on this code sometime in the coming years.

Some project ideas:

 * Add an extra hard mode to the game.
 * Add a dungeon with infinite levels.
 * Create a dedicated server.
 * Multithread the packet handler.
 * Multithread the entity logic.
 * Add script support for entities and items.
 * Add persistent levels and servers.
 * Add fully 3D physics and world geometry.
 * Renovate the OpenGL code to a modern standard.

Have fun,

The scrypt key derivation function was originally developed for use in the Tarsnap online backup system and is designed to be far more secure against hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt.

We estimate that on modern (2009) hardware, if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key, the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt (to find the same password), and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against PBKDF2.

Details of the scrypt key derivation function are given in a paper which was presented at the BSDCan'09 conference:

Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing the entire album of music and saves them as separate audio files. To do this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file. Besides, Flacon makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both for all tracks at once or for each tag separately.

DNSCrypt is a protocol for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver, using high-speed high-security elliptic-curve cryptography.

While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local network, which is often the weakest point of the chain, against man-in-the-middle attacks.

dnscrypt-proxy is a client-implementation of the protocol. It requires a DNSCrypt server on the other end.

One option would be to "advise" the other-window function to execute some form when switching to the minibuffer.

For example, the following code will turn the minibuffer prompt green when you cycle back to it using other-window, and if you land on a non minibuffer window it turns the prompt grey:

(defadvice other-window (after adv-other-window-minibuffer
                               (COUNT &optional ALL-FRAMES))
  "Make minibuffer prompt green when switched to"
  (if (minibufferp)
      (set-face-attribute 'minibuffer-prompt nil
                          :foreground "green" :background "black")
    (set-face-attribute 'minibuffer-prompt nil
                          :foreground "dark grey" :background "black")))

(ad-activate 'other-window)

Of course you are not limited to just setting the minibuffer prompt, but it's not clear to me exactly what effect your are trying to achieve.

 At the WG 14 meeting in Kona, Hawaii, in October, 2015, there was general agreement the committee should start thinking about what was next for a revision of the C Standard. I agreed to draft a revision charter, adapted from those for C99 and C11. As in prior charters, the intention of this charter is to present a statement of principles and a plan of attack. This charter does not identify any technical issues since those are immaterial at this stage.

Although the committee is not required to begin work on revising the current standard, there is much happening that can or does influence C directly. Examples are the evolution of C-like programming languages (C++, Java, and C#), the rising security threat on the Internet, the increased awareness of programming language vulnerabilities, the slowing progress of Moore's law leading to a growing need to exploit increased parallelism and concurrency, and updates to standards in related areas such as floating-point arithmetic.

 Terminals1 are quite weird. Most modern users assume that they can just have straightfoward keybindings. Right? To bind Ctrl+i to something, they listen for Ctrl+i in their application. If they want to bind Ctrl+Shift+i to something different, they certainly can, they just listen for Ctrl+Shift+i as well. Naturally, they can rebind Tab without rebinding Ctrl+i/Shift+i. And if they can bind something like Ctrl+\, surely they can also bind something like Ctrl+=. Of course, whether a keybinding like Alt+char is actually succesfully picked up by their terminal application is entirely independent of the quality of their network connection. They know that Ctrl+char and Ctrl+Shift+char are distinct keybindings, and that if those aren't distinct keybindings, certainly Alt+char and Alt+Shift+char must not be distinct either.

 In certain situations, AVC denial messages may not be logged when SELinux denies access. Applications and system library functions often probe for more access than required to perform their tasks. To maintain least privilege without filling audit logs with AVC denials for harmless application probing, the policy can silence AVC denials without allowing a permission by using dontaudit rules. These rules are common in standard policy. The downside of dontaudit is that, although SELinux denies access, denial messages are not logged, making troubleshooting more difficult.

Edit: OK, you say you're using C++. I'm editing my response. I would use the C preprocessor and then grep for the variable. It will appear in the first place.

cpp -I...(preprocessor options here) file.cpp | grep variable

The C preprocessor will join all the includes that the program uses, and the definition has to be before any usage of that variable in the file. Not a perfect thing, but without an IDE or a complete language description/managing tool, you only have the text.

Another option would be using ctags. It understands the C and C++ syntaxes (among others), and can be searched for variables and functions using command line tools, emacs and vi, among others.

The Council is ultimately accountable for the Fedora Project as a whole, and is responsible for providing advice to and oversight of other Fedora governance bodies and teams as needed.

 Speaking of Christopher Wellons, he's got a very interesting post over at null program on mutable strings and Emacs buffer passing style. Wellons starts by pointing out that strings in Emacs Lisp, like many other languages, have a fixed size and any operation that changes the size requires that a new string be allocated and current content copied into it. That can be a problem when you're building up a string incrementally. Next, he observes that Elisp has a natural character-oriented data structure: buffers. Why not use a buffer to build up the string components and then turn the buffer into a string with buffer-string. Something along the lines of:
** [2017-04-08 Sat 11:20] [[http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/05/27/][Emacs Lisp Buffer Passing Style « null program]]
Emacs Lisp strings are mutable, fixed-length character (multibyte) or byte (unibyte) arrays. Any operation that would change its length requires allocating a new string object. This is common in many programming languages’ strings. Python, Java, and JavaScript go even further, with strings being completely immutable.

In these languages, performing many string operations at a time, especially with the += operator, allocates many temporary strings. It’s also awkward. For these situations, Java provides a class, StringBuilder, so that these operations can be done with a temporary, efficient, mutable data structure that will emit the final string when complete.

It turns out that Yum stores its history in an SQLite database in /var/lib/yum/history. I was able to concoct this simple query that does exactly what I need. The following command prints out every manually entered transaction id and yum command in history. Note that the database name will be different on your system.

$ sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/yum/history/history-2014-12-03.sqlite "select tid, cmdline from trans_cmdline"

For example (truncated for brevity):

$ sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/yum/history/history-2014-12-03.sqlite "select tid, cmdline from trans_cmdline"

5|install firefox

You may notice that some ids are missing. That's because only the manually run yum commands are shown. Updates are not shown.

By default, the order of execution is the same as specified in the prerequisites list, unless there are any dependencies defined between these prerequisites.

abc: x y z

The order is x y z.

abc: x y z

The order would be x z y.

But ideally, you should design your Makefiles so that it wouldn't rely on the order in which prerequisites are specified. That is, if y should be executed after z, there must be a y : z dependence.

Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery.

A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in a file called header files and include that header file wherever it is required.

Why we use header file.

The main goal is optimization. We wrap up common constants, macros, system wide global variables, and function prototypes in a single file and use when ever it is required via #include (pre-processing directive ).

Different stages of a c file : From source file to object / executable file.

1- We write our C source code in foo.c file like

#include "stdio.h"
int main(){

}

2- this command gcc -E foo.c -o foo.i will generate intermediate file often called as processed file or pure c file means at this stage gcc compiler expand the header files and include its source code to our .c file and generate a single .i file.

3- This command gcc -O2 -S -c foo.c will generate foo.s file which is called as GNU's assembler file.

The Function prototype serves the following purposes –

1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return.
2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function.
3) It tells the data types of the each of the passed arguments.
4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.

Therefore essentially, function prototype specifies the input/output interlace to the function i.e. what to give to the function and what to expect from the function.

Prototype of a function is also called signature of the function.

 Here's another example. Let's say that you want to open a file whenever you start Emacs. The function to open a file is called find-file, and you can give it the name of the file to open. The code below switches to a buffer visiting file "todo.org" in your home directory. If the buffer doesn't exist, it will be created. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically when the buffer is saved - for example, when you press C-x C-s (save-buffer) in that buffer.

You might, however, be in a situation where you want Gnus to expire mail at once in some groups, wait for a month in others, and finally never do expiring in a third set of groups.

The ls(1) command is pretty good at showing you the attributes of a single file (at least in some cases), but when you ask it for a list of files, there's a huge problem: Unix allows almost any character in a filename, including whitespace, newlines, commas, pipe symbols, and pretty much anything else you'd ever try to use as a delimiter except NUL. There are proposals to try and "fix" this within POSIX, but they won't help in dealing with the current situation (see also how to deal with filenames correctly). In its default mode, if standard output isn't a terminal, ls separates filenames with newlines. This is fine until you have a file with a newline in its name. And since I don't know of any implementation of ls that allows you to terminate filenames with NUL characters instead of newlines, this leaves us unable to get a list of filenames safely with ls.

Writing & Editing
Post by Email

Post by Email is a way of publishing posts on your blog by email. Any email client can be used to send the email, allowing you to publish quickly and easily from devices such as cell phones. Please note you can only publish to one blog using one e-mail message at a time.

    The instructions from this guide are referring to the WP Admin dashboard. You can get to this dashboard by adding /wp-admin to the end of your site’s url (e.g.: example.wordpress.com/wp-admin)

Generating a Post by Email Address

Before you can publish by email, you must generate a special email address. This address is unique to you and must be kept secret (anyone that knows the email address can publish a post to your blog).

    First go to Dashboard -> My Blogs.
    Screen Shot 2014-06-20 at 3.19.51 PM
    Make sure Post by Email is enabled in your Screen Options.
    Screen Shot 2014-06-20 at 3.16.02 PM
    Locate the blog that you wish to post to and click Enable.
    Screen Shot 2014-06-20 at 4.53.35 PM
    You now have a special email address you can use for sending post by email. If you want to add the address to your address book, you can download it as a vCard:
    Screen Shot 2014-06-20 at 3.36.06 PM

    Note: The secret email address is per-user account, not per-blog. If you have a multiuser blog, each of your blog’s users can create their own Post by Email address, regardless of their user role.

    For users in the Contributor user role, any emailed posts will be saved as pending, rather than published. They will receive confirmation of their post with the post content in the email, but will not receive a second email when their post is approved.

↑ Table of Contents ↑
Sending Emails

Once you have your Post by Email address, sending an email is simple:

The email subject is used as your post’s title. The body is the post’s contents. A few minutes after receiving your email, you should receive a notification email informing you of the published post’s details.

    Note: Please remember to send the email to your secret email address, not to the example given in the image above.

↑ Table of Contents ↑
Mail Formatting

Your email can be plain text or formatted. As much formatting as possible will be retained, although the Post by Email system will strip unnecessary HTML tags so that your email is displayed correctly. Note that you will need to use an email client that supports rich text or HTML formatting in order to make use of this feature. Most website based clients (Hotmail, Gmail) do support this, as do most desktop clients (Outlook, Mail). You may need to switch your client into rich text or formatted mode.

↑ Table of Contents ↑
Attachments

Image attachments will be included in your published post as follows:

    Single images will be displayed inline (a single image is defined as an image without an image immediately following it).
    Multiple images will be displayed as a gallery.

Multiple galleries and single images are allowed in the same post. Note that using the [nogallery] shortcode will disable all galleries.

If you have purchased the Space Upgrade, then the following additional attachment types will be supported:

    Supported audio files (mp3) will be displayed using the WordPress Audio player.
    All other files (doc, PDF, etc) will be displayed as links to the attachment.

Additionally, if you’ve purchased the VideoPress Upgrade, you’ll be able to send mp4, mov, wmv, avi, mpg, and m4v files as attachments, which will then be displayed using the WordPress video player.

Note that you can send your attachments to:

media+YOUR_SECRET_EMAIL@post.wordpress.com

Your attachments will just be stored in your account without creating a new post – the attachments will appear alongside your other media.

↑ Table of Contents ↑
Shortcodes

Special shortcodes can be embedded in your email to configure various aspects of the published post:

    [category x,y,z]
    [excerpt]some excerpt[/excerpt]
    [tags x,y,z]
    [delay +1 hour]
    [comments on | off]
    [status publish | pending | draft | private]
    [password secret-password]
    [slug some-url-name]
    [title Your post title]
    [end] – everything after this shortcode is ignored (i.e. signatures). Make sure it’s on its own line with a blank line above it.
    [slideshow] – replaces the auto-gallery with a slideshow
    [nogallery] – disables the auto-gallery and displays all images inline
    [more] – more tag
    [nextpage] – pagination
    [geotag on | off] – override your geotagging privacy defaults to enable or disable the showing of geo information
    [publicize off|twitter|facebook] – change Publicize options (see below)
    [poll]question and answers[/poll] – insert a Polldaddy poll into your post (see below)

Shortcodes can be included anywhere in the body of your email and must be in lowercase. There should be no spaces between the left square braket and the shortcode content.

The initial build went great and the system was working as soon I turned it on. However, I began to notice an intermittent freeze while doing "normal" HTPC stuff (mostly via Boxee). Originally, I just attributed it to Boxee issues, but then I ran into it outside of Boxee several times.

Curious, I started by running MemTest86+ using the default tests. Interestingly, the tests run along fine for about an hour (and are on maybe the 3rd complete test cycle) when things go south. Out of nowhere, the screen goes black except for a vertical band of red, green, and blue "static" on the left edge of screen. At that point, a hard reset is needed.

На плате всего 6 разъемов для кулеров:
PowerFan (3pin) - абсолютно тупой нерегулируемый разъем. Любой кулер дает максимальные обороты.
ChassisFan2 (3pin), ChassisFan3 (3pin) - расположены под сокетом проца. Регулируемые - для любого кулера можно вручную выставить обороты. При этом ChassisFan3 имеет 10 уровней оборотов, а ChassisFan2 - всего 4.
CPUFan1 (4pin), ChassisFan1 (4pin) - поддерживают автоматическую регулировку оборотов в зависимости от температуры проца, но лишь кулеров с PWM-регулировкой, т.е. 4-пиновых кулеров. 3-пиновые кулеры на этих разъемах крутятся максимально.
CPUFan2 (3pin)-полностью дублирует параметры CPUFan1, но позволяет регулировать 3-пиновые кулеры.

CPUFan(1,2) и ChassisFan1 настраиваются одинаково. Задаются 2 параметра:
Target Temperature - "желаемая" температура, выше которой кулер начинает разгоняться, "пытаясь" ее поддерживать.
Target Fan Speed - скорость вентилятора, когда температура процессора ниже Target Temperature.
Грубо говоря Target Fan Speed - скорость в простое (минимальная), Target Temperature - температурный порог разгона вентиляторов.
И CPUFan(1,2) и ChassisFan1 ориентируются на температуру процессора, но параметры настраиваются отдельно.
Таким образом, вы имеете 3 разъема, пляшущих от температуры процессора.
Грубо говоря рекомендации такие: Target Fan Speed - на минимум (Level 1), Target Temperature - 45-60 по желанию.

Cjdns was designed to be used with a friend of a friend topology. It builds an overlay network which traverses NAT (Network Address Translation), exposing all ports of every node to every other node within the network. Those who are used to relying on NAT to protect their devices may find this troublesome.

At one point it was expected that each person who peered would do so with only trusted friends. You need not trust relaying nodes with the confidentiality or integrity of your packets, however, if you wish to restrict access to certain services, it is your responsibility to implement effective access control rules.

Links between nodes may be established over deliberate UDP links across the internet, or over deliberate or automatic connections across Ethernet, Wireless access points, Ad-hoc connections, or various system-specific transmission and addressing protocols.

Thanks for getting back to me about this issue.  It's been several
months since I reported the reconnection problem.  I have been
able to work around it by setting erc-server-error-occurred to nil
in a disconnect hook:

(add-hook 'erc-disconnected-hook
          #'(lambda (nick host-name reason)
              ;; Re-establish the connection even if the server closed it.
              (setq erc-server-error-occurred nil)))

So yes, when the root cause of the disconnection is a server error,
erc-server-error-occurred is set to true and the reconnect logic
in erc-server-reconnect-p is bypassed ... so reconnection does not
happen.

In the example I sent you, I believe the server closed the connection
and erc-server-error-occurred was set to true because of a ping
timeout.

A single doubt is left... the bibtex compilation is not performed during the exportation process, should be done manually, Am I write?

***** For completeness ****

$ cd ~/.emacs.d/

Either create the repository

$ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
$ cd org-mode

or update it

$ cd org-mode
$make up1

Then compile the sources

$ make all
$ sudo make install

After this... I followed the advice of Eric,  open an emacs session without personal configuration

$ make vanilla

in the emacs session evaluate one line at the time, for that use =M-:=

(add-to-list 'load-path "contrib/lisp/")
(require 'ox-bibtex)

Finally, open the =ox-bibtex-example.org= and export it!!!

I did the work for me, however, the bibtex compilation should be done by hand.

Cheers.

This page is for the benefit of new TeX system users. As such, it tries to be short and simple. (An even shorter getting-started document is available.)
What's going on here?

TeX is a typesetting language. Instead of visually formatting your text, you enter your manuscript text intertwined with TeX commands in a plain text file. You then run TeX to produce formatted output, such as a PDF file. Thus, in contrast to standard word processors, your document is a separate file that does not pretend to be a representation of the final typeset output, and so can be easily edited and manipulated.

Here are a couple of links with further background:

    The levels of TeX web page explains some of the most common components and terms used throughout TeX.

Introduction

This is a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for English-speaking users of TeX.

The questions answered here cover a wide range of topics, but typesetting issues are mostly covered from the viewpoint of a LaTeX user. Some of the questions answered have little relevance to today’s users; this is inevitable — it’s easier to add information than it is to decide that information is no longer needed. The set of answered questions is therefore in a state of slow flux: new questions are answered, while old questions are deleted … but the whole process depends on the time available for FAQ maintenance.

You may use the FAQ

    by reading a printed document,
    by viewing a PDF file, with hyperlinks to assist browsing: copies are available formatted so that they could be printed on A4 paper or on North American “letter” paper, or
    via Scott Pakin’s Visual FAQ, which shows LaTeX constructions with links to FAQ explanations of how they may be created.

     Join ##math for all aspects of mathematics (all areas and levels are catered for). Occasional seminars are given in #mathematics (these will be advertised in the topic of #math; volunteers to give such a talk are welcome!). #not-math is for anything that would be off-topic in #math. 

    Questions about math software (computer algebra systems and numeric computation systems) belong in #math-software or their respective official channel. 

    We have a FAQ.
    Everything not about mathematics (including jokes, even ones about mathematics) should be taken to #not-math (or some more appropriate channel: this includes questions about CASes, such as Maple, Mathematica, Maxima, and so on [#math-software], or how to write some algorithm in C [##c]). 

    Questions (at any level) are very welcome, but no-one will give you answers to your homework. If you say vague things like "can someone help me?" or "does anyone know about calculus?" or "are there any experts on stable homotopy theory here?" you are unlikely to get a sensible response. 

    There are other channels for related areas on freenode: ##cs, #gnuplot, ##physics, ##philosophy, #octave, ##math-software, ##statistics, etc. You may get better answers in one of those than in #math. 

    Generally speaking, you should reduce your question to one or two sentences that clearly describe what you don't understand---we won't do your homework for you, but can help you with general concepts. Note that posting a link to a pastebin is probably not the best way unless you really need a picture. Use MathBin to paste LaTeX if necessary. 

    #math no longer has math bots, use Wolfram|Alpha if you need to.
    Most importantly, don't be annoying, but see the Guidelines.

There are a couple of symbols the emacs‘ lisp interpreter gives special meaning to. Since for some reason these never made it into my long-term memory I collect them here for later reference. Quotes are copied from all over the internet. Reference to the source is given in the last column.

Sometimes it is useful to launch emacs with a predefined environment variables (python virtual environments, go workspaces, etc).

To preload environment variables, create a file my-venv.sh in the Virtual Environments directory ~/.emacs.d/virtualenv, where you can put all initialization in a simple shell script.

For example, to activate python virtualenv, you can just use the source function.
** [2017-04-22 Sat 23:00] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/65lf9y/show_manpages_always_in_the_same_window/][Show manpages always in the same window : emacs]]
You need to customize display-buffer-alist. In Emacs 26 (which has not yet been released) there is a new function with the provided example to do exactly what you are asking:

*** New function 'display-buffer-reuse-mode-window' is an action function
suitable for use in 'display-buffer-alist'. For example, to avoid creating
a new window when opening man pages when there's already one, use
(add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
     '("\\`\\*Man .*\\*\\'" .
       (display-buffer-reuse-mode-window
        (inhibit-same-window . nil)
        (mode . Man-mode))))

You can either use a development build of Emacs, or just copy the relevant function, display-buffer-reuse-mode-window, from the sources into your init file.
** [2017-04-22 Sat 23:00] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/65lf9y/show_manpages_always_in_the_same_window/][Show manpages always in the same window : emacs]]
I use my major-mode-dedication package: https://github.com/tom-seddon/major-mode-dedication

Once you've got it installed, with a man page visible in the window of your choice, do C-x D D with that window active. Future man buffers will then appear in that window. You can also set this up from code (I've got a function that creates a particular window layout).

What's different about it from the other similar stuff I've seen: it uses a window parameter to hold the list of modes to show in that window, rather than just looking for a window that happens to show a buffer of the right mode. So the right window will be found, even if a buffer of the appropriate type isn't currently being shown there. This way, you can also have multiple modes associated with a given window. (e.g., my standard window layout has ag-mode and occur-mode popping up in the same window.) This may or may not be something you want, but personally I prefer it.
** [2017-04-22 Sat 23:00] [[https://github.com/tom-seddon/major-mode-dedication][tom-seddon/major-mode-dedication: Dedicate an emacs major mode to a particular emacs window]]
This package lets you dedicate a major mode to a particular emacs window. Any time some elisp uses display-buffer or show-buffer-other-window to show a buffer with that major mode, that buffer will appear in its dedicated window. This fixes virtually all cases where windows might ordinarily pop up somewhere unexpected when using facilities like help, rgrep, compilation, and so on.

You can dedicate multiple major modes to the same window, and all appropriate buffers will appear in that window (one at a time…). And you can dedicate the same major mode to multiple windows, in which case a sensible window will be chosen each time.

And being based on major mode rather than particular buffer, it can also be useful for things like ag-mode or shell mode (which pop up multiple buffers, all with the same major mode).

Functionality, performance, and other benefits of this feature may vary depending on system configuration.

“Conflict free” and “conflict-free” means “DRC conflict free”, which is defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules to mean products that do not contain conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold) that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries. Intel also uses the term "conflict-free" in a broader sense to refer to suppliers, supply chains, smelters and refiners whose sources of conflict minerals do not finance conflict in the DRC or adjoining countries. Intel processors manufactured before January 1, 2013 are not confirmed conflict free. The conflict free designation refers only to product manufactured after that date. For Intel Boxed Processors, the conflict free designation refers to the processor only, not to any additional included accessories, such as heatsinks/coolers.

Listing of these RCP does not constitute a formal pricing offer from Intel. Please work with your appropriate Intel representative to obtain a formal price quotation.

System and Maximum TDP is based on worst case scenarios. Actual TDP may be lower if not all I/Os for chipsets are used.

Low Halogen: Applies only to brominated and chlorinated flame retardants (BFRs/CFRs) and PVC in the final product. Intel components as well as purchased components on the finished assembly meet JS-709 requirements, and the PCB / substrate meet IEC 61249-2-21 requirements. The replacement of halogenated flame retardants and/or PVC may not be better for the environment.

libglvnd is a vendor-neutral dispatch layer for arbitrating OpenGL API calls between multiple vendors. It allows multiple drivers from different vendors to coexist on the same filesystem, and determines which vendor to dispatch each API call to at runtime.

** [2017-04-23 Sun 21:09] [[https://www.gimp.org/irc.html][GIMP - IRC Channels Related to GIMP]]


Several IRC channels and mailing lists are available for discussing GIMP-related topics. IRC offers real-time communication, but be aware that there may be long periods of silence in the channels when other users are busy or away from their keyboards. When you join the GIMP IRC channels, please do not ask if somebody can help you. If you have a question, ask directly and then wait patiently to see if someone answers. Other recommendations can be found at the bottom of this page.

The official GIMP IRC channels are on GIMPNet (irc.gimp.org) and have existed for more than 10 years. Many channels related to GTK+ and GNOME are also on GIMPNet.

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for the linux kernel. Coding style is very personal, and I won’t force my views on anybody, but this is what goes for anything that I have to be able to maintain, and I’d prefer it for most other things too. Please at least consider the points made here.

First off, I’d suggest printing out a copy of the GNU coding standards, and NOT read it. Burn them, it’s a great symbolic gesture.
** [2017-04-23 Sun 21:37] [[https://developer.gnome.org/programming-guidelines/stable/][GNOME Programming Guidelines]]
 This article contains several guidelines and suggestions for programmers working in and with the GNOME stack. This is intended for programmers to know about the development processes, conventions and philosophies behind GNOME applications and the stack of libraries supporting them. By knowing “the way things are done” in the GNOME ecosystem, it is hoped that programmers will find use of GNOME APIs and development of new applications easier and more natural, and will produce code which is legible and maintainable over a long period of time by a diverse team of programmers.

shackle gives you the means to put an end to popped up buffers not behaving they way you'd like them to. By setting up simple rules you can for instance make Emacs always select help buffers for you or make everything reuse your currently selected window.

Здесь не будет сотен страниц ненужной белиберды вроде "набора стихов" и "формул в шесть этажей".

Изложение ведётся конспективно, с упором на физиков и их конкретные LaTeXнические проблемы. Написанию диплома в латехе посвящена серия статей об использовании основных команд LaTeX для написания несложной технической документации. Другие материалы по LaTeX можно посмотреть, кликнув на тег ЛаТеХ.

I’ve been using Emacs for nearly all my editing for a couple years now, and I’m getting more hungry for highly personalized customizations. I often need to email files I’m working on, so I wrote up this little command (Throw it in your .emacs):

(defun mail-current-buffer ()
  "Send the current buffer to email (for Mac)"
  (interactive)
  (shell-command (format "open -a Sparrow %s" (buffer-file-name))))
(define-key global-map "\C-cm" 'mail-current-buffer)

This opens a new message with the file in the current buffer attached. If you use another mail app, replace Sparrow with its name. The last line binds the function to C-c C-m. Really, this will open the current buffer in any application you choose to put in that command besides Sparrow, so perhaps you have some other handy ideas?

I guess the next step is just doing my email in Emacs.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Compared to displacement and velocity, acceleration is like the angry, fire-breathing dragon of motion variables. It can be violent; some people are scared of it; and if it's big, it forces you to take notice. That feeling you get when you're sitting in a plane during take-off, or slamming on the brakes in a car, or turning a corner at a high speed in a go kart are all situations where you are accelerating.
Acceleration is the name we give to any process where the velocity changes. Since velocity is a speed and a direction, there are only two ways for you to accelerate: change your speed or change your direction—or change both.

Below is the simple online Tangential and Radial acceleration calculator. Radial acceleration is the result of change in direction of velocity, and hence it is given as ar = v2/ r. The tangential acceleration (at) is the rate of change of tangential velocity of an object traveling in a circular orbit. Find radial and tangential acceleration using this tangential acceleration calculator. In the below radial acceleration calculator enter radius, velocity, acceleration and time and click calculate.

Furthermore, the PGS LCP constraint solver has a new option to terminate as soon as the residual (error) is below a specified tolerance (instead of terminating after a fixed number of iterations). There is preliminary support to load some MuJoCo MJCF xml files (see data/mjcf), and haptic experiments with a VR glove.

A lot of people are using iPython these days because of the lack of this feature on the default Python shell, but this is only by default, and if you are using iPython only because of the tab completion, forget about installing extra stuff, you only have to do this little trick:

 Зима — это по истине прекрасное время года. Но именно зимой я всегда задумываюсь о том, что встаю и ухожу на работу, а затем и возвращаюсь с работы, не видя солнечного света. Сегодня мне захотелось визуализировать данные о восходе и заходе солнца и соотнести их со столь привычным для многих распорядком дня (рабочие часы и время бодрствования). Для работы мы будем использовать Python (pandas + matplotlib). Посмотрим, что из этого получилось.

Для начала нам понадобятся данные, которые можно визуализировать. Я нашел подходящий набор здесь. На странице мы видим две таблицы, содержащие данные о дате, восходе и заходе солнца, зените и продолжительности светового дня, а также данные о гражданских, навигационных и астрономических сумерках. Для работы нам понадобится время восхода и захода солнца, информация о гражданских сумерках, и, само собой дата, которую мы сможем представить на таймлайне.

Код на python может быть помещен в файл с расширением .py и отправлен интерпретатору для выполнения. то классический подход, который обычно разбавляется использованием среды разработки, например pyCharm. Однако, для python (и не только) существует другой способ взаимодействия с интерпретатором — интерактивные блокноты jupyter, сохраняющие промежуточное состояние программы между выполнением различных блоков кода, которые могут быть выполнены в произвольном порядке. Этот способ взаимодействия позаимствован у блокнотов Mathematica, позже аналог появился и в MATLAB (Live script).

Pint is a Python package to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities: the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement. It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and to different units.

It is distributed with a comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes and constants. Due to its modular design, you can extend (or even rewrite!) the complete list without changing the source code. It supports a lot of numpy mathematical operations without monkey patching or wrapping numpy.

It has a complete test coverage. It runs in Python 2.6 and 3.X with no other dependency. It is licensed under BSD.

Todoman should run fine on any Unix-like OS. It's been tested on GNU/Linux, BSD, and macOS. We do not support windows, and very basic testing seems to indicate it does not work.

Open Android Studio with a valid studio project (if you don't have one, simply create one empty). After you've your project open, go to Tools => Android => AVD Manager. Note that this menu does not appear if you don't have a valid Android Studio project open.

Now you can safely close Android Studio if you only want the AVD Manager.
From command line

If you want to use the command line you'll first need to create the virtual device using avdmanager, located under $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/avdmanager like so:

$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/avdmanager create avd --force --name testAVD --abi google_apis/x86_64 --package 'system-images;android-23;google_apis;x86_64'

After you created the device to emulate, then you need to open it with emulator, which is located under $ANDROID_HOME/tools/emulator. The command for the previously created device should be something like:

emulator -avd testAVD

If it crashes saying something like...

[140022905190208]:ERROR:./android/qt/qt_setup.cpp:28:Qt library not found at ../emulator/lib64/qt/lib

Try running the emulator command inside the $ANDROID_HOME/tools folder, otherwise won't work.

Two reasons:

    The default ClojureScript REPL (as described in the "quick start" tutorial) assumes that it is running in a teletype environment. This works fine with nREPL tools in that environment (e.g. lein repl in Terminal.app or gnome-terminal, etc), but isn't suitable for development environments that have richer interaction models (including editors like vim [fireplace] and emacs [CIDER] and IDEs like Intellij [Cursive] and Eclipse [Counterclockwise]).
    Most of the more advanced tool support for Clojure and ClojureScript (code completion, introspection and inspector utilities, refactoring tools, etc) is packaged and delivered as nREPL extensions.

Piggieback provides an alternative ClojureScript REPL entry point (cemerick.piggieback/cljs-repl) that changes an nREPL session into a ClojureScript REPL for eval and load-file operations, while accepting all the same options as cljs.repl/repl. When the ClojureScript REPL is terminated (by sending :cljs/quit for evaluation), the nREPL session is restored to it original state.

Clojure will be the preferred language.]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A literate program combines code and prose (documentation) in one file format. The term was coined by Donald Knuth in his September 1983 paper, Literate Programming, available online. Decades later, Knuth asserts that literate programming:

Was the most important outcome of creating TeX.
Enables faster and more reliable creation of software.
Manages complexity better than any other methodology he's aware of.
Is a source of joy when programming.
Enables extraordinary achievements in creating software.
Can these claims be made by non-Knuth programmers who adopt literate programming (LP) for themselves? I believe the time is ripe to find out, as we finally have a tool that is simple (plain text), flexible, and powerful, with mature LP capabilities: Emacs Org mode.

Thus this repository is a collection of literate programming (LP) examples, using Emacs Org mode. These examples are intended to be directly usable (copy and start hacking), and/or to serve as educational literate programs. The long-term goal is to collect and organize a corpus of useful LP examples that point towards Knuth's vision of programs-as-literature.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scala (/ˈskɑːlɑː/ skah-lah)[9] is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise,[10] many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.[8]

Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code.[11] Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw strings, and no checked exceptions.

The name Scala is a portmanteau of scalable and language, signifying that it is designed to grow with the demands of its users.[12]

Note

The code for testing EIN is horribly broken, but I regularly hand check the code running against IPython's suite of sample notebooks. It's a worse-is-better solution to problem requiring a time-consuming solution.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. Julia’s Base library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed open source C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia’s built-in package manager at a rapid pace. IJulia, a collaboration between the Jupyter and Julia communities, provides a powerful browser-based graphical notebook interface to Julia.
** [2017-05-01 Mon 21:40] [[https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Plotting-capabilities][Plotting capabilities · sympy/sympy Wiki]]
All this is about the new plotting module and mostly covers the matplotlib backend.

Many examples of the plotting module capabilities are given in the docstrings and the IPython notebooks that are part of the module. However, there are many other types of plots that can be implemented and those are not listed anywhere. Hence this page on which the capabilities of other software packages will be compared to the current plotting module.

All the syntax examples will be from the highest level convenience functions. No BaseSeries subclasses will be visible. The Plot class will not be called directly.

The most explicit form of the arguments is given for the API examples (eg. plot(expr, (var, from, to)) instead of plot(expr) which finds the independent variable and uses a default range).

Remark about the Plot class: The low-level way to create a plot is to create instances of BaseSeries and append them to a Plot instance. However, for convenience, Plot also supports creating these BaseSeries instances itself for a small subset of all BaseSeries subclasses. Check the factory class Series for details.

Remark about the examples from other software packages: Their APIs will differ.

All in pure Python ;)]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Bayesian method is the natural approach to inference, yet it is hidden from readers behind chapters of slow, mathematical analysis. The typical text on Bayesian inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this was the author's own prior opinion.

After some recent success of Bayesian methods in machine-learning competitions, I decided to investigate the subject again. Even with my mathematical background, it took me three straight-days of reading examples and trying to put the pieces together to understand the methods. There was simply not enough literature bridging theory to practice. The problem with my misunderstanding was the disconnect between Bayesian mathematics and probabilistic programming. That being said, I suffered then so the reader would not have to now. This book attempts to bridge the gap.

If Bayesian inference is the destination, then mathematical analysis is a particular path towards it. On the other hand, computing power is cheap enough that we can afford to take an alternate route via probabilistic programming. The latter path is much more useful, as it denies the necessity of mathematical intervention at each step, that is, we remove often-intractable mathematical analysis as a prerequisite to Bayesian inference. Simply put, this latter computational path proceeds via small intermediate jumps from beginning to end, where as the first path proceeds by enormous leaps, often landing far away from our target. Furthermore, without a strong mathematical background, the analysis required by the first path cannot even take place.

SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more. It is also the name of a very popular conference on scientific programming with Python.

The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give SciPy a try!
** [2017-05-02 Tue 12:48] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style][Posting style - Wikipedia]]
When a message is replied to in e-mail, Internet forums, or Usenet, the original can often be included, or "quoted", in a variety of different posting styles.

The main options are interleaved posting (also called inline replying, in which the different parts of the reply follow the relevant parts of the original post), bottom-posting (in which the reply follows the quote) or top-posting (in which the reply precedes the quoted original message). For each of those options, there is also the issue of whether trimming of the original text is allowed, required or preferred.

For a long time the traditional style was to post the answer below as much of the quoted original as was necessary to understand the reply (bottom or inline). Many years later, when email became widespread in business communication, it became a widespread practice to reply above the entire original and leave it (supposedly untouched) below the reply.

While each online community differs on which styles are appropriate or acceptable, within some communities the use of the "wrong" method risks being seen as a breach of netiquette, and can provoke vehement response from community regulars.

SciPy recommends import scipy as sp in its documentation, though personally I find that rather useless since it only gives you access to re-exported NumPy functionality, not anything that SciPy adds to that. I find myself doing import scipy.sparse as sp much more often, but then I use that module heavily. Also

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
You might encounter more of these as you start using more libraries. There's no registry or anything for these shorthands and you're free to invent new ones as you see fit. There's also no general convention except that import lln as library_with_a_long_name obviously won't occur very often.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Mechanical Universe... And Beyond, is a 52-part telecourse filmed at the California Institute of Technology, and produced by Caltech and INTELECOM Intelligent Telecommunications (a non-profit consortium of California community colleges). The series introduces university level physics, covering topics from Copernicus to quantum mechanics.

Produced starting in 1985, the videos make heavy use of historical dramatizations and visual aids to explain physics concepts. The latter were state of the art at the time, incorporating almost 8 hours of computer animation created by computer graphics pioneer Jim Blinn. Each episode opens and closes with a "phantom" lecture by Caltech professor David Goodstein.[further explanation needed] After more than a quarter century, the series is still often used as a supplemental teaching aid, for its clear explanation of fundamental concepts such as special relativity.[1]

The Mechanical Universe lectures are actual freshman physics lectures from Physics 1a and 1b courses at the California Institute of Technology. The room seen in the videos is the Bridge lecture hall.

This package provides two minor modes which automatically recompile Emacs Lisp source files. Together these modes guarantee that Emacs never loads outdated byte code files.

auto-compile-on-save-mode re-compiles source files when they are being saved and auto-compile-on-load-mode does so before they are being loaded (by advising load and require). Both modes only ever re-compile a source file when the respective byte code file already exists but is outdated. Otherwise they do not compile the source file.

Even when using auto-compile-on-save-mode it can happen that some source file is newer than the respective byte code file, which is a problem because by default Emacs load the byte code file even when the respective source file has been modified more recently.

Starting with Emacs version 24.4, setting load-prefer-newer to t prevents outdated byte code files from being loaded. However this does not cause re-compilation of the source file, to actually do that auto-compile-on-load-mode is still required.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
► Subscribe to my channel // http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...

There's so much confusion around dx, especially among Calc 1 and Calc 2 students. And with good reason. dx doesn't start to feel relevant until later on, when you start working with multivariable functions, multiple integrals, and differential equations.

But that's no reason not to at least address dx in an introductory way. In this video, we'll talk about a few of the simplest explanations for what dx does, what it tells us to do, and what it represents.

When you're just starting out with integrals, for the most part, it's okay to think about dx as just notation. It just comes with the integral symbol, and you don't need to know exactly why it's there in order to know that you're supposed to integrate.

Once you start changing variables, it's important to know that the dx always tells you which variable to integrate. That's why you'll see dx with a function in terms of x, dt with a function in terms of t, and dy with a function in terms of y. You'll also need to understand that your limits of integration (if you're dealing with a definite integral), will need to match the variable in your function and the variable in your dx/dt/dy/etc.

When you get to multivariable calculus and multiple integrals, you'll need to realize that seeing dx dy at the end of the integral tells you to integrate first with respect to x, and then with respect to y.

But most importantly, you'll want to understand that dx represents the differential, or the difference between two values of x. It's the distance between two values of x. So, when you use a Riemann sum, or trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a curve, delta x is the width of each rectangle (or trapezoid).

When you switch from these approximation methods, and start using the integral instead to find exact area, that delta x has to change to dx in order to match the integral. Essentially what you're doing is saying that delta x represents a larger width, which is why you can only get an approximation. But dx represents and infinitely small distance, which is why it gets paired with the integral, and allows you to find exact area, instead of just an approximation.

And that's why you always need a dx whenever you're using an integral.

Hi, I’m Krista! I make math courses to keep you from banging your head against the wall. ;)

Math class was always so frustrating for me. I’d go to a class, spend hours on homework, and three days later have an “Ah-ha!” moment about how the problems worked that could have slashed my homework time in half. I’d think, “WHY didn’t my teacher just tell me this in the first place?!”

So I started tutoring to keep other people out of the same aggravating, time-sucking cycle. Since then, I’ve recorded tons of videos and written out cheat-sheet style notes and formula sheets to help every math student—from basic middle school classes to advanced college calculus—figure out what’s going on, understand the important concepts, and pass their classes, once and for all.

    When we diminish a mode, we are saying we want it to continue doing its work for us, but we no longer want to be reminded of it. It becomes a night worker, like a janitor; it becomes an invisible man; it remains a component, perhaps an important one, sometimes an indispensable one, of the mechanism that maintains the day-people's world, but its place in their thoughts is diminished, usually to nothing. As we grow old we diminish more and more such thoughts, such people, usually to nothing. -- Will Mengarini

 In conventional algebra, letters and symbols are used to represent numbers and the operations associated with them: +, -, ×, ÷, etc. Doing so can help simplify and solve complex problems.

Unfortunately, like ordinary algebra, the opposite seems true initially. This is probably because simple examples always seem easier to solve by common-sense methods!

Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantity, space, structure, and change. Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers. It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems. It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily. Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.

Some of the main features of MathJax include:

    High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages

    Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special setup for the reader

    Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers

    Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other advanced functionality

    Powerful API for integration with other web applications

I am pretty sure I am not the only one annoyed by the fact that I can’t see more than one message in the echo area at a time. I have some functions I put in some hooks which display certain messages, and of course only the last one is usually visible. Of course, I could switch to the *Messages* buffer (using C-h e, for instance), but then I’d have to press C-x 1 to delete its window. And what if I have more than one window and I press C-h e? Not fun. I’m pretty sure its configurable to some extent, but I wanted something different. I wanted to have something like momentary-string-display. I didn’t, however, like the fact that it mangled the text in the buffer I’m in, even if only temporarily. Well, actually the best thing to use would be… message.

The hexo-renderer-org is really greate but it doesn’t support use emacs’s htmlize to render my code block, and that’s the main reason I create my fork.

This fork support both highlight.js and htmlize to work as syntax highlight backend, you can choose which you like.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thank you for the A2A. I apologise for the late answer. I had no idea that I could even get requests…I haven’t explored the Quora app very well :p

Japanese and English anime subtitles (kitsunekko/net) is a brilliant source for not just only Japanese, but English subtitled anime. You can even request anime to be subtitled via their forum, which is linked to on their main page.

For English and Japanese subtitles, the A-Z indexes are brilliantly large, and, you can also order by last updated. Unfortunately, their Korean and Chinese subs are meagre.

Available content varies on whether the subtitles are there in a certain language, but, often, full series are there. The episodes can usually be downloaded individually, though you can often find them all in a .rar file at the end of the episodw list. Sometimes, there is only a .rar file listed, so, if you want a single episode, you’ll have to download the whole .rar and get it from there. However, this doesn’t happen enough to hinder.

Once you have the file, you can upload it anywhere. In my experience, the Japanese subs aren’t watermarked, either. Though I can’t say for the other languages, they usually aren’t. Depending on the language, the index is updated with new series/additions to series in a good amount of the time, with timestamps on when the last upload was. The Japanese subtitles update weekly for some anime.

They also have archives for previous years (I saw one immediately for 2014, when checking). There are a few other archive directories to explore at the end of each index, such as the ability to download a whole genre in Japanese subtitles!

I hope that you didn’t mind my general deviation from specifially Japanese subs: I thought that this was a good way to explain. Hope that this helps you out!

You can start a pomodoro for the task at point or select one of the last tasks that you clocked time for. Each clocked-in pomodoro starts a timer of 25 minutes and after each pomodoro a break timer of 5 minutes is started automatically. Every 4 breaks a long break is started with 20 minutes. All values are customizable.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I don't see a lot of attention to one of my favorite tools for immersion: Video Game Lets Plays. I love leaving a playlist on in the background while studying some flashcards or non-Japanese work. I have been able to find a ton of these in the past couple years, and it is a lot easier to find good video/audio quality now along with enjoyable commentary and decent editing.
To search in youtube just enter the name of the game in Japanese and add the Japanese word for Let's Play: 実況プレイ (じっきょうプレイ) or just adding 実況 to the name of the game is fine too.
Example: in order to find a Kingdom Hearts let's play search キングダムハーツ実況.
If you are unsure of the name of the game in Japanese it will be in the game's Wikipedia article if it is a native Japanese game. If it is not a native Japanese game one trick to find the name is to go onto play-asia and look up the Japanese version of the game, and the name of the game will be listed in Japanese in the further info section.
Overall I mainly stick to native Japanese games and within this it's fairly easy to find at least one good series for each game. Handheld games tend to have poorer audio quality and are harder to find in general.
Here are a few channels I'm currently enjoying(the most important thing is that you find stuff that you enjoy at the end of the day):

This book gives simplified explanations of how some electronic components work in a circuit. It also gives practical examples of building 2 simple projects. The physics isn’t complex and it doesn’t attempt to explain the ins and outs of “electrons”, “atoms” and such like. Instead, it will give you an understanding of what the components actually DO so that you can immediately begin to design your own simple circuits. The book may be copied as many times as required within an educational system.

INTRODUCTION

I first became interested in electronics when I was age 10 (as long ago as 1961). In those days, transistors were only just being introduced and most equipment still used thermionic valves or “tubes” as the Americans would call them. Much of my learning was by practical experiment. I blew my Dad up only once by connecting 350 volt capacitors the wrong way round; electrocuted the window cleaner (but not fatally) and gave myself several high voltage shocks during the learning experience. This is not to be recommended so just remember that voltages in excess of 50 volts can be painful, if not downright dangerous. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my book. I guarantee it will be more interesting than any previous electronics course at school or college and you’ll understand how the components work after just a few minutes - not the fifteen years it took me to get a grip on it!

Seeing Theory is a project designed and created by Daniel Kunin with support from Brown University's Royce Fellowship Program. The goal of the project is to make statistics more accessible to a wider range of students through interactive visualizations.


Statistics is quickly becoming the most important and multi-disciplinary field of mathematics. According to the American Statistical Association, "statistician" is one of the top ten fastest-growing occupations and statistics is one of the fastest-growing bachelor degrees. Statistical literacy is essential to our data driven society. Yet, for all the increased importance and demand for statistical competence, the pedagogical approaches in statistics have barely changed. Using Mike Bostock’s data visualization software, D3.js, Seeing Theory visualizes the fundamental concepts covered in an introductory college statistics or Advanced Placement statistics class. Students are encouraged to use Seeing Theory as an additional resource to their textbook, professor and peers.

One of the most amazing innovations in online learning over the past few years has been the growth and development of massive open online courses, better known as MOOCs. Generally speaking, MOOCs are college-level courses made available, free of charge, for unlimited participation by any and all students interested in the subject matter. MOOCs are often offered by highly prestigious colleges and universities like Harvard, Stanford and, most predominantly, MIT, and taught by the same professors and instructors that teach them on their famous campuses. Given the recent appearance of MOOCs in the virtual world, it’s not surprising that one of the most popular academic subjects for MOOC classes is computer science. There are literally dozens of courses available on both the undergraduate and graduate levels across the breadth of computer-related topics. Below you will find the course titles and links to some of the most popular computer science MOOCs.

When you are surfing on the web, all your browsing history and activities can be tracked by anyone on the internet. Most of the hackers and others always will be on a look out for vulnerable connections. When you are downloading something from the web, there is a probability for others to know your computers IP address, system information etc., and use this information to launch an attack.

To avoid these attacks, you can hide your IP address or fool the hackers with a false IP address. This is done by using the re-routing process such that all your downloads are done using a remote server or by using proxies, this is called “Anonymous Torrenting”.

For example, never before could you so starkly illustrate the fact that 15 countries in Africa offer the pill for free to their citizens, while only 2 in North America (and those two aren’t the United States or Canada). Never before could you look at a map of the entire universe.

Or, to use a slightly less consequential example, never before could you see how many countries have red in their flags versus how many countries have blue in their flags. Regardless of the information they convey, you can learn a lot from maps. Here are 24 maps that will make you look at the world in different ways — or, possibly, will just amuse you a little bit.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The C programming language is a popular and widely used programming language for creating computer programs. Programmers around the world embrace C because it gives maximum control and efficiency to the programmer.

If you are a programmer, or if you are interested in becoming a programmer, there are a couple of benefits you gain from learning C:

You will be able to read and write code for a large number of platforms -- everything from microcontrollers to the most advanced scientific systems can be written in C, and many modern operating systems are written in C.
The jump to the object oriented C++ language becomes much easier. C++ is an extension of C, and it is nearly impossible to learn C++ without learning C first.
In this article, we will walk through the entire language and show you how to become a C programmer, starting at the beginning. You will be amazed at all of the different things you can create once you know C!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Name/Finger protocol, written by David Zimmerman, is based on Request for Comments document RFC 742 (December 1977) as an interface to the name and finger programs that provide status reports on a particular computer system or a particular person at network sites. The finger program was written in 1971 by Les Earnest who created the program to solve the need of users who wanted information on other users of the network. Information on who is logged-in was useful to check the availability of a person to meet. This was probably the earliest form of presence information for remote network users.
Prior to the finger program, the only way to get this information was with a who program that showed IDs and terminal line numbers (the server's internal number of the communication line, over which the user's terminal is connected) for logged-in users. Earnest named his program after the idea that people would run their fingers down the who list to find what they were looking for.[1]
The term "finger" had, in the 1970s, a connotation of "is a snitch": this made "finger" a good reminder/mnemonic to the semantic of the UNIX finger command (a client in the protocol context).

The Standard Model is a kind of periodic table of the elements for particle physics. But instead of listing the chemical elements, it lists the fundamental particles that make up the atoms that make up the chemical elements, along with any other particles that cannot be broken down into any smaller pieces.
The complete Standard Model took a long time to build. Physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897, and scientists at the Large Hadron Collider found the final piece of the puzzle, the Higgs boson, in 2012.
Use this interactive graphic to explore the different particles that make up the building blocks of our universe.

As we’ve said before, Japanese isn’t actually as hard to learn as it’s often made out to be. Unlike English, for example, Japanese follows its own grammatical rules far more rigidly, pronunciation is easy because there is only one variant of each vowel sound to choose from (none of this tomayto/tomahto business), and it’s possible to create entire, perfectly meaningful and valid sentences without uttering a single pronoun or bothering to conjugate a verb.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thanks for the info! Sadly, this isn't a workaround that would work for any other built-in package.

This seems to be a deeper issue with package.el itself, because it refuses to install org because it's built-in, even though it would get installed to a different place (~/.emacs.d/elpa). I've kicked off an email on emacs-devel about this, but until / unless this gets fixed, looking into a more fine-grained control over package installation might be desirable.

I suggest we either:

Ignore built-in packages by default and use :pin built-in to load them
Ensure that when a package gets pinned, that version is the one that's loaded
Introduce a customize variable to control this

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This script installs the latest GitHub versions of some fine [[https://www.gnome.org/][GNOME]] themes into the current user's .themes folder. Run the script again whenever you want to get the latest theme updates! Many of themes are constantly being updated with bugfixes and enhancements.
It supports GNOME versions 3.18 to 3.24, and will install the correct version according to your system. So if, for example, you upgrade from GNOME 3.18 to GNOME 3.20, you would want to run the script again. (GNOME 3.20 completely overhauled the theming system, so older themes are incompatible.)
All of these themes provide at least GTK+ theming (for both GTK+3 and GTK+2) and many also provide a shell theme. You are free to mix and match GTK+ themes with shell themes! Some themes also provide application theming (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) though you will have to install that separately. For Firefox, note that there is also a generic [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adwaita/][GNOME 3 theme]] that might improve its appearance for some themes, though your mileage will vary.
To change your theme, run the GNOME Tweak Tool and go to the Appearance tab.
To avoid rebuilding themes if there was no change, the script caches identifiers in the file .install-gnome-themes-cache in the current user's .themes folder. Delete it to force rebuilding all themes.
If you already have themes of the same names installed in your .themes folder, they will be deleted, so backup the folder first if you want to keep them. Other themes will not be touched.
Note that building the latest version of some themes is heavy work, and thus this script installs some big dependencies (for example, SASS is used to compile CSS and InkScape is used to render images). That's the price of living on the cutting edge.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A parser combinator library for Emacs Lisp similar to Haskell’s Parsec library.
Overview
This work is based on [[https://github.com/jwiegley/][John Wiegley]]’s [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-pl][emacs-pl]]. The original [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-pl][emacs-pl]] is awesome,
  but I found following problems when I tried to use it:

  It only contains a very limited set of combinators
  Some of its functions (combinators) have different behaviors than their
    Haskell counterparts
  It can’t show error messages when parsing fails

So I decided to make a new library on top of it. This library, however, contains
  most of the parser combinators in Text.Parsec.Combinator, which should be
  enough in most use cases. Of course more combinators can be added if necessary!
  Most of the parser combinators have the same behavior as their Haskell
  counterparts. parsec.el also comes with a simple error handling mechanism so
  that it can display an error message showing how the parser fails.
So we can

  use these parser combinators to write parsers easily from scratch in Emacs
    Lisp like what we can do in Haskell
  port existing Haskell program using Parsec to its equivalent Emacs Lisp

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
exec-path-from-shell
A GNU Emacs library to ensure environment variables inside Emacs look
the same as in the user's shell.
Motivation
Ever find that a command works in your shell, but not in Emacs?
This happens a lot on OS X, where an Emacs instance started from the GUI inherits a
default set of environment variables.
This library solves this problem by copying important environment
variables from the user's shell: it works by asking your shell to print out the
variables of interest, then copying them into the Emacs environment.
Compatibility
At a minimum, this package assumes that your shell is at least UNIX-y: if
(getenv "SHELL") evaluates to something like ".../cmdproxy.exe", this
package probably isn't for you.
Further, if you use a non-POSIX-standard shell such as tcsh or fish, your
shell will be asked to execute sh as a subshell in order to print
out the variables in a format which can be reliably parsed. sh must
be a POSIX-compliant shell in this case.

This library extends linum-mode to highlight current line number.
It requires Emacs 24.4 or later.
To use this package, add these lines to your .emacs file:
    (require 'hlinum)
    (hlinum-activate)
And by using M-x linum-mode, you can see line numbers with highlighting current line number.
You can customize the color of highlighting current line by changing linum-highlight-face. By default, hlinum highlights current line only in the active buffer. To highlight current line in all buffers, change linum-highlight-in-all-buffersp to t.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Disaster lets you press C-c d to see the compiled assembly code for the
C/C++ file you're currently editing. It even jumps to and highlights the
line of assembly corresponding to the line beneath your cursor.
It works by creating a .o file using make (if you have a Makefile) or the
default system compiler. It then runs that file through objdump to generate
the human-readable assembly.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs' ibuffer-mode is a wonderful replacement for the built-in
list-buffer command, and allows buffers to be grouped
programatically, e.g. by major mode.
If, like me, you mostly work on version-controlled files, you might
like to see your buffers grouped by the associated version control
project.
That's where ibuffer-vc comes in: it lets you:

Group your buffers by their parent vc root directory
See the VC status of the associated files
Sort buffers by their VC status

This page lists all available builtin lexers and the options they take.
Currently, all lexers support these options:

stripnl
Strip leading and trailing newlines from the input (default: True)
stripall
Strip all leading and trailing whitespace from the input (default:
False).
ensurenl
Make sure that the input ends with a newline (default: True).  This
is required for some lexers that consume input linewise.

New in version 1.3.


tabsize
If given and greater than 0, expand tabs in the input (default: 0).
encoding
If given, must be an encoding name (such as "utf-8"). This encoding
will be used to convert the input string to Unicode (if it is not already
a Unicode string). The default is "guess".
If this option is set to "guess", a simple UTF-8 vs. Latin-1
detection is used, if it is set to "chardet", the
[[https://chardet.github.io/][chardet library]] is used to
guess the encoding of the input.

New in version 0.6.

The ssh-deploy plug-in for Emacs makes it possible to effortlessly deploy local files and directories to remote hosts via SSH and FTP. It also makes it possible to define remote paths per directory and whether or not you want to deploy on explicit save actions or not and whether you want transfers to be asynchronous or not. For asynchronous transfers you need a setup which doesn't require a interactive authorization. The plug-in also enables manual upload and download of files and directories. It also features automatic detection of remote changes. You can also check differences between local files and remote files if you have ediff installed. You can rename and delete files and directories synced to remote host. You can also browse remote hosts. Lastly you can easily open remote hosts terminal if you have tramp-term installed. For asynchronous transfers you need to have a setup which allows automatic connections to servers via SSH and FTP and have async.el installed.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Request.el is a HTTP request library with multiple backends.  It
supports url.el which is shipped with Emacs and curl command line
program.  User can use curl when s/he has it, as curl is more reliable
than url.el.  Library author can use request.el to avoid imposing
external dependencies such as curl to users while giving richer
experience for users who have curl.
As request.el is implemented in extensible manner, it is possible to
implement other backend such as wget.  Also, if future version of
Emacs support linking with libcurl, it is possible to implement a
backend using it.  Libraries using request.el automatically can
use these backend without modifying their code.
Request.el also patches url.el dynamically, to fix bugs in url.el.
See for the bugs fixed by request.el.

SYN
s
Syn packet, a session establishment request. The first part of any TCP connection.


ACK
ack
Ack packet, used to acknowledge the receipt of data from the sender. May appear in conjunction with other flags.


FIN
f
Finish flag, used to indicate the sender’s intention to terminate the connection to the receiving host.


RESET
r
Indicates the sender’s intention to immediately abort the existing connection.


PUSH
p
Signals the immediate push of data from the sending host to the receiving host. For interactive applications such as telnet, the main issue is the quickest response time, which this “push” flag signals.


URGENT
urg
Urgent data should take precedence over other data. For example, a Ctrl-C to terminate a FTP download.


Placeholder
.
If the connection does not have a syn, finish, reset, or push flag set, this placefolder flag will be found after the destination port. Note that it also appears in conjunction with the ack flag.
