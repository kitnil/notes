However, you can choose to use different interpreters for different
recipes in modern GNU make by assigning the SHELL variable as a target-
specific variable [1]:

    SHELL = /usr/bin/guile

    all: guile sh

    guile: ; ; this is the default and runs in guile

    sh: SHELL = /bin/bash
    sh: ; # this is overridden and runs in the shell
