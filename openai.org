As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I have been trained on a diverse range of internet text and have knowledge about a wide range of topics including, but not limited to:

Science and Technology
History
Geography
Arts and Literature
Mathematics
Medicine and Biology
Philosophy
Social Sciences
Sports and Games
I can provide explanations, give definitions, offer advice, provide information, and answer questions on these and many other topics. Just let me know what you would like to know and I'll do my best to assist you.

* Alternatives

Here are some open-source and self-hosted alternatives to OpenAI:

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It can be used to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models, and it provides a comprehensive and flexible platform for building and deploying AI applications.

PyTorch: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook. It provides a flexible and user-friendly interface for building and training machine learning models, and it is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing applications.

Caffe: Caffe is an open-source deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to use, and it provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and deploying deep learning models.

Theano: Theano is an open-source numerical computation library for Python, optimized for fast execution on GPUs and CPUs. It provides a flexible and powerful platform for building and deploying machine learning models, and it is well-suited for large-scale, computationally intensive applications.

Keras: Keras is an open-source high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks, and it is designed to be fast and easy to use.

These are just a few of the many open-source and self-hosted alternatives to OpenAI. Each of these platforms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you may find that one of them is a better fit for your needs and interests than others.
