** How to say keepalived to become master manually?

To manually force Keepalived to become the master node, you can use the keepalived command with the --takeover option. This option causes Keepalived to immediately take over as the master node, even if the current master is still running.

Here's the command to force Keepalived to become the master:

sudo keepalived --takeover

Note that running this command will override the normal behavior of Keepalived, which is to use the VRRP protocol to elect a master node based on priority and other factors. You should only use this command when you need to manually intervene in the Keepalived failover process.

Also, keep in mind that manually forcing Keepalived to become the master node can cause network disruption if it's not done carefully. Make sure that the current master node is no longer functioning before forcing a takeover.

** What other ways to do the same thing?

In addition to the keepalived --takeover command, there are other ways to manually force Keepalived to become the master node:

    Modify the priority of the Keepalived process: Each Keepalived process has a priority value, and the node with the highest priority becomes the master. You can modify the priority of the Keepalived process manually to make it the highest. You can do this by editing the Keepalived configuration file (/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf) and setting the priority directive to a higher value than the current master node.

    Stop the Keepalived process on the current master: If the current master node is still running but you want to force a takeover, you can stop the Keepalived process on the current master. This will cause Keepalived to detect a failure on the master node and trigger a failover. You can do this by running the sudo service keepalived stop command on the current master node.

    Modify the virtual IP address: The VRRP protocol used by Keepalived relies on a shared virtual IP address that is used by the master node. You can manually modify the virtual IP address to force Keepalived to switch to a new master node. You can do this by editing the Keepalived configuration file (/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf) and setting the virtual_ipaddress directive to a new IP address that is not currently in use.

Note that these methods should be used with caution, and only when necessary. Manually intervening in the Keepalived failover process can cause network disruption and should only be done when absolutely necessary.
