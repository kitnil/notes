** How to say keepalived to become master manually?

To manually force Keepalived to become the master node, you can use the keepalived command with the --takeover option. This option causes Keepalived to immediately take over as the master node, even if the current master is still running.

Here's the command to force Keepalived to become the master:

sudo keepalived --takeover

Note that running this command will override the normal behavior of Keepalived, which is to use the VRRP protocol to elect a master node based on priority and other factors. You should only use this command when you need to manually intervene in the Keepalived failover process.

Also, keep in mind that manually forcing Keepalived to become the master node can cause network disruption if it's not done carefully. Make sure that the current master node is no longer functioning before forcing a takeover.
