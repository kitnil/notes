** [[https://github.com/mooz/keysnail][mooz/keysnail: Allows you to bind commands to key sequences in Mozilla Firefox]]
 KeySnail is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox that aims to be a competitor and lightweight alternative to Vimperator. Unlike Vimperator, KeySnail provides comfortable browsing experience for Emacs users, but its target users are not limited to.
** [[https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc][viewvc/viewvc: ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories.]]
 ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. It generates templatized HTML to present navigable directory, revision, and change log listings. It can display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those versions. Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much more prettily than the average textual command-line program output.
 Features

     Support for filesystem-accessible CVS and Subversion repositories.
     Support for path-based authorization, including parsing and honoring Subversion authz configuration files.
     RSS feed generation for tracking changes to repositories or individual items within repositories.
     Individually configurable virtual host support.
     Line-based annotation/blame display.
     Revision graph capabilities (via integration with CvsGraph) (CVS only).
     Syntax highlighting support.
     Bonsai-like repository query facilities.
     Template-driven output generation.
     Colorized, side-by-side differences.
     Tarball generation (by tag/branch for CVS, by revision for Subversion).
     Localization support based on the Accept-Language request header.
     Ability to run either as CGI script or as a standalone server.
     Regexp-based file searching.
     INI-like configuration file (as opposed to requiring actual code tweaks).

 Requirements

 The only hard software requirement for running ViewVC is a suitable version of Python. The specifics of that, as well as all other requirements, depend on what you want to do with the tool. As those have changed somewhat over the years, it's best to consult the INSTALL file of the specific ViewVC release you wish to evaluate for its exact requirements. Here are pointers to the INSTALL files for the current major release lines:

     ViewVC 1.1.x
     Unreleased bleeding edge (1.2-dev)

 ctable.el is a table component for emacs lisp. Emacs lisp programs can display
 a nice table view from an abstract data model. The many emacs programs have the
 code for displaying table views, such as dired, list-process, buffer-list and
 so on. So, ctable.el would provide functions and a table framework for the
 table views.

 A keynote talk at MuniHac 2016 given by Jasper Van der Jeugt.

 Hakyll is a static site generator written in Haskell. It is more like a library
 than a conventional application, since the configuration is done in Haskell as
 well -- a bit like Xmonad. In this talk, we will give a high-level overview of
 the advantages of static site generators in general and build a quick site
 together. After that, we will dive a bit deeper and examine how semi-automatic
 dependency tracking works in the library.

 Color Identifiers is a minor mode for Emacs that highlights each source code identifier uniquely based on its name. It is inspired by a post by Evan Brooks.

 Currently it supports Scala (scala-mode2), JavaScript (js-mode and js2-mode), Ruby, Python, Emacs Lisp, Clojure, C, C++, and Java. You can add support for your favorite mode by modifying color-identifiers:modes-alist and optionally calling color-identifiers:set-declaration-scan-fn.

 Check out the demo.

 Mingus is a frontend for GNU Emacs to the Music Player daemon. The interface closely, though not strictly, resembles that of ncmpc, which I had been using before (the main drawback of ncmpc for me was it‚Äôs apparent lack of support for unicode). It has some advantages over other clients, mainly in the field of playlist editing. This is achieved through marking and regions as you are used too in emacs and in dired. Mingus also provides a point-of-insertion for inserting new songs. This can be handy to drop a song after the currently playing one (enqueue), but is more flexible. Mingus is distributed under the GPL.

** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/][The GNU C Library]]
 What is glibc?

 The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

 The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible, portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008.

 The project was started circa 1988 and is almost 30 years old. You can see the complete project release history on the wiki.

 Despite the project's age there is still a lot to do so please Get Started and Get Involved!
 Current Status

 The GNU C Library releases every 6 months. See the NEWS file in the glibc sources for more information.

     The current stable version of glibc is 2.24, released on August 5, 2016.
     The current development version of glibc 2.25, releasing on or around February 1, 2017.

** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/][The GNU C Reference Manual - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation]]
  The GNU C Reference Manual is a reference for the C programming language, as implemented by the GNU C Compiler.

 This manual is strictly a reference, not a tutorial. Its aim is to cover every linguistic construct in GNU C, but not the library functions (which are documented elsewhere). This manual would probably not make a good introductory book for new programmers, although those who know languages other than C should be able to learn C using it.

 The v0.2.5 release of the manual is now available, which includes a number of corrections suggested by readers. If you don't feel like building the manual from the Texinfo source, you can also read an HTML version or PDF version of the manual.

 For additional information, please see the manual's project page at Savannah.

 Almost all GNU project languages and utilities have manuals in Info format. Unfortunately for us users, the Debian people decided that the GNU Free Documentation License is a "non-free" license. When the GNU project switched to using it for manuals the Debian people put them in a non-free repository. In my opinion, the behaviour of both sides was bad. Debian derivatives like Ubuntu keep that structure.

 Published on Sep 29, 2013

 Xubuntu = ubuntu +Xfce, and its running awesomely on the nexus 7 (the old one). In this in-depth video I will describe my experience with it and show how well some common tasks work so you could decide if its worth the effort of getting it running (it definitely is).

 This video was moved from a different (removed) account - originally uploaded at August 29th, 2013.

 Links & tips:

 http://forum.xda-developers.com/showt... - multiROM, you can get pretty much everything from there, there is also a short guide on how to get Ubuntu working with multiROM which includes link to download Ubuntu 13.04 for he N7. There are also links for kernels with kexec-hardboot patch (required by multiROM) and other guides for related things...

 Install Xfce: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" in ubuntu terminal or just search "xubuntu-desktop" in ubuntu software center.

 Remove Unity after installing Xfce (you don't have to): http://askubuntu.com/questions/292394... (it's in the first answer...)

 Get Flash player working: http://hwswbits.blogspot.cz/2013/04/f...

 Fix touchscreen rotation:
 in the terminal: xinput (to find id of elan-touchscreen device - 7 in my case)
 xinput set-prop 7 "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1 (to rotate the touchscreen right - same rotation as the display obviously)

 Running Windows and Age of Empires: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN3_td...

 If you are bored with your (now old) nexus 7, this is a great way to revive it and make it do new cool (and most importantly useful) things... Nothing from the process of getting it running was particularly difficult, but if you don't have basic knowledge about flashing roms & kernels, don't know what a custom recovery is, etc. - than you should start with tutorials on that, just use google. The same thing applies about using Ubuntu/Linux.

 I encourage you to make questions, I will answer any question which isn't answered in the video or in this description, if it will be important i will also add the answer to this description.

** [[https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2014][ctfs/write-ups-2014: Wiki-like CTF write-ups repository, maintained by the community. 2014]]
 There are some problems with CTF write-ups in general:

     they‚Äôre scattered across the interwebs
     they don‚Äôt usually include the original files needed to solve the challenge
     some of them are incomplete or skip ‚Äòobvious‚Äô parts of the explanation, and are therefore not as helpful for newcomers
     often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

 This repository aims to solve those problems.

 It‚Äôs a collection of CTF source files and write-ups that anyone can contribute to. Did you just publish a CTF write-up? Let us know, and we‚Äôll add a link to your post ‚Äî or just add the link yourself and submit a pull request. Spot an issue with a solution? Correct it, and send a pull request.

 This script listens to meetings I'm supposed to be paying attention to and pings me on hipchat when my name is mentioned.

 It sends me a transcript of what was said in the minute before my name was mentioned and some time after.

 It also plays an audio file out loud 15 seconds after my name was mentioned which is a recording of me saying, "Sorry, I didn't realize my mic was on mute there."

 Uses IBM's Speech to Text Watson API for the audio-to-text.

 Currently relies on Splunk as a data store, but can be extended to use an open-source tool instead.

 Relies on Uberi's SpeechRecognition PyAudio and API wrapper: https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition

 If you want to use FeedBurner for your feed, you will likely need to decide upon a unique identifier. For example, if your site were called ‚ÄúThyme‚Äù and hosted on the www.example.com domain, you might use ‚Äúthymefeeds‚Äù as your unique identifier, which we‚Äôll use throughout this section for illustrative purposes. In your Pelican settings, set the FEED_ATOM attribute to thymefeeds/main.xml to create an Atom feed with an original address of http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml. Set the FEED_DOMAIN attribute to http://feeds.feedburner.com, or http://feeds.example.com if you are using a CNAME on your own domain (i.e., FeedBurner‚Äôs ‚ÄúMyBrand‚Äù feature).

 There are two fields to configure in the FeedBurner interface: ‚ÄúOriginal Feed‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeed Address‚Äù. In this example, the ‚ÄúOriginal Feed‚Äù would be http://www.example.com/thymefeeds/main.xml and the ‚ÄúFeed Address‚Äù suffix would be thymefeeds/main.xml.

 git-remote-dropbox is a transparent bidirectional bridge between Git and Dropbox. It lets you use a Dropbox folder or a shared folder as a Git remote!

 This Git remote helper makes Dropbox act like a true Git remote. It maintains all guarantees that are provided by a traditional Git remote while using Dropbox as a backing store. This means that it works correctly even when there are multiple people operating on the repository at once, making it possible to use a Dropbox shared folder as a Git remote for collaboration.

 Once the helper is installed, using it is as simple as adding a remote like dropbox://path/to/repo.

  I thought it would be interesting to have Emacs read text on the screen. Why? Sometimes I get tired of reading ;) Seriously though, this has applications in accessibility, learning to read, translation, taking a break from looking at the screen, reading emails out loud, fun and games, etc‚Ä¶ Seems like a worthwhile endeavor!
