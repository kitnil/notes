#+TITLE: Emacs org-mode

* Documentation
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/org][spacemacs]]

* Video
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4][Harry Schwartz]] demonstrates some of the nifty features of Org mode

"Org mode is an outliner, markup language, task manager, calendar, contact
manager, and who-knows-what-else. I use it to write documents and presentations,
manage my todo list, and I even write my Emacs configuration in it.

In other words, Org is taking over my life.

Iâ€™ll be introducing some of the functionality of Org, demonstrating what it can
do, and showing how you, too, can become pleasantly obsessed with a wacky,
overgrown outlining tool."
