** Description

Good question and I had to follow it up as PulseEffects is not perfect, occasionally crashing when another program (Telegram) sends a notification sound.  
I couldn't find a GUI for this so parameters need to be set when initializing the command.  
  
1\. Install the package *swh-plugins*   
  
2\. Load the plugin, parameters can be changed but this worked on initial test:

Code: [[https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=137348#][Select all]]

#+begin_src c
pactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=compressor plugin=sc4_1882 label=sc4 control=1,1.5,300,-20,3,1,10
#+end_src

(note - may first need to /pactl unload-module module-device-manager/  if using KDE)  
  
3\. Open Pulse Audio Volume Control and switch the playback sink to "LADSPA Plugin SC4 ..."  
  
4\. Enjoy compressed sound!  
  
The parameters (the control=1,1.5,300,-20,3,1,10 part above) for this compressor are described in Steve Harris' LADSPA Plugin Docs [[http://plugin.org.uk/ladspa-swh/docs/ladspa-swh.html#tth_sEc2.91][http://plugin.org.uk/ladspa-swh/docs/la ... th\_sEc2.91]] :  
  
1\. RMS/peak: The balance between the RMS and peak envelope followers.RMS is generally better for subtle, musical compression and peak is better for heavier, fast compression and percussion.  
2\. Attack time (ms): The attack time in milliseconds.  
3\. Release time (ms): The release time in milliseconds.  
4\. Threshold level (dB): The point at which the compressor will start to kick in.  
5\. Ratio (1:n): The gain reduction ratio used when the signal level exceeds the threshold.  
6\. Knee radius (dB): The distance from the threshold where the knee curve starts.  
7\. Makeup gain (dB): Controls the gain of the makeup input signal in dB's.  
8\. Amplitude (dB): The level of the input signal, in decibels.  
9\. Gain reduction (dB): The degree of gain reduction applied to the input signal, in decibels.  
  
For limiting purposes, lower the threshold, try -30 to -40 and increase the ratio to 10 or so. Settings will vary so you may have to experiment a bit.

There is also description for using TAP plugins including Lookahead Limiter. It's described for radio use but should be fine for desktop use:

If you delve deeper into Steve Harris' LADSPA Plugin Docs linked above you will find several limiters are included in that collection. Maybe another day's experiment. [[https://forums.debian.net/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif]]
