** How to understand TV dimensions and find the optimal viewing distance

The bigger the screen the better the viewing experience, right? Well, not always. A lot will depend on the size of the room, as sitting too close to the television can cause eye strain, especially when watching for a long period of time. Of course, on the other hand, you certainly don’t want to have to squint to see the image properly.

There is a formula for calculating TV size to optimal viewing distance which will help you find that sweet viewing spot. This can be found in the TV measurement chart below.

*** Table of TV sizes and distance from the screen

** What’s the best height to place or mount the TV?

This may differ from room to room, but the ideal height is to have the middle of the TV screen at eye level or slightly below. This is because lifting your eyes is very tiring and can cause strain when settling in for a movie marathon or bingeing your favourite series.

Most experts recommend the centre of the TV to be around one metre from the floor, however, this may differ depending on how tall you are and the height of your sofa or chair.

Of course, there are some exceptions, if you tend to watch television while sitting on a recliner or while lying in bed, the TV should be mounted higher. This could be as high as 1.8m. But in this case, it is best to have an adjustable mount that you can easily alter the angle depending on your position.

** Find the perfect viewing distance from your TV

Remember being told off as a kid for sitting too close to the TV? Well, it seems parents really do know best. Having your TV too close to your sofa can cause temporary eye strain or eye fatigue, especially when watching for hours on end. Similarly, if you are too far away and find yourself struggling to see the action, then your eyes will feel the strain. 

Luckily there are some formulas to help you find the ideal viewing distance. If you have a Full HD TV, then one popular rule is to simply use 4.2cm of viewing distance for every inch of the diagonal screen size. Therefore, a 50-inch screen would require you to sit 2.1m away.

However, this can be slightly adjusted when it comes to 4K and Ultra HD TVs. This is because resolution also plays a role in determining the ideal distance from the screen. Due to the improved image clarity and sharpness, the conversion is much lower. In this case, you can use 2.1cm of viewing distance for every inch of the diagonal screen size.

Small TVs can range from 32-inch TVs to 43-inch TVs

- A 32-inch TV is approximately 75cm wide and 45cm high
- A 40-inch TV is approximately 90cm wide and 50cm high
- A 42-inch TV is approximately 93cm wide and 52cm high
- A 43-inch TV is approximately 97cm wide and 56cm high

*** What to consider before purchasing a 32-inch TV?

It doesn’t seem that long ago that this size TV was considered to be on the large side. Now very much in the small bracket, a 32-inch television still has many of the features that you will find in bigger models.

A great example of this is the LG 32LQ63006LA, which is a Full HD 32-inch TV that has an intelligent processor that enhances both colour and clarity. It also features AI Sound that delivers immersive sound quality, ThinQ AI – which allows you to easily control your TV with just your voice – and a built-in Game Optimiser to ensure you can easily change your settings to best fit the game you’re playing.

*** What to consider before purchasing a 40-43-inch TV?

A great choice for those with limited space, these mid-range TVs work exceptionally well in small or average-sized living rooms. The [[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/oled-evo/oled48c45la/][*LG OLED48C45LA*]] is a popular choice, thanks to its versatile size and advanced technology.

Delivering incredible picture quality, it features a Brightness Booster that uses high luminance to create an even crisper, bolder and brighter image.

** Converting the dimensions of large TVs – 48, 49, 50, 55 and 60 inches to cm

If you want to understand just how big a TV is or if you’re looking to convert TV dimensions from inches to cm, then the guide below should help.

  [[https://www.lg.com/content/dam/channel/wcms/uk/lg-experience-new/how-to-measure-and-read-tv-sizes/lg-magazine_lg-v30-unveil-ifa-2017_sub-img5-M.jpg]]

Large TV sizes can range from 48-inch TVs to 60-inch TVs

- A 60-inch TV is approximately 134cm wide and 77cm high

*** What to consider before purchasing a 48-60-inch TV?

As mentioned above, if you are thinking of buying a TV in this size range then you would ideally need to sit between 2-2.5m away from the screen. Fortunately, this distance is halved if you choose a 4K television. This means even an average living room could accommodate a 60-inch TV.

*** What to consider before purchasing a TV that is 65-inches or above

At one time a screen this size would have been reserved for home cinemas, but thanks to the advances of OLED displays and higher resolutions, these huge TVs can now be found in living rooms around the world.

Even if you purchase an 88-inch TV, the perfect viewing distance is just over 1.8m if the model is 4K or higher. As long as you have enough space, there is no reason why you cannot go as big as possible. Of course, with that being said, you will also want to consider the screen height and make sure the middle of the TV screen is just below eye level.

Previously you would have also had to consider the viewing angle, especially in a large space where seats are not just directly in front of the TV. But OLED screens can be viewed with no luminance degradation even at drastic viewing angles. So all that’s left is to explore which option is right for you.

Should you want a 65-inch display, the  *[[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/oled-evo/oled65c45la/][65 inch LG OLED evo C4 4K Smart TV 2024]]*  is a great option for those with a tighter budget.

If your budget stretches further, then the [[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/oled-evo/oled65g46ls/][*65 inch LG OLED evo G4 4K Smart TV 2024*]] is optimal for movie lovers and gamers alike.

It uses deep learning algorithms to send information to the backlight dimming blocks. It may sound technical, but what it delivers is a sharper and more natural image that minimises any halo effect.

But if you’re really looking to impress your friends and family, the  *[[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/oled-evo/oled77g45lw/][77 inch LG OLED evo G4 4K Smart TV 2024]]*  is sure to do the job. This Gallery Design TV can be hung flush to the wall like a piece of art, whilst possessing an incredible amount of groundbreaking technology. Boasting uncompromised picture quality at any viewing angle, immersive sound and incredible clarity, it will impress whether bingeing your favourite series, watching the latest blockbuster or playing the newest video games.

** Choosing a TV size according to room

An important factor to consider when buying a TV is the size of the room that you intend to keep it in. Finding the ideal [[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/][*TV*]] size for your room is key to achieving an immersive viewing experience along with matching the aesthetics of the environment. 

*** Large TVs

Larger rooms such as living spaces and family rooms can allow for setting up a larger entertainment space so that you get an immersive experience. A large room can usually accommodate a TV size bigger than 55-inches. When placed at an optimal viewing distance with a sound system that complements it, a  *[[https://www.lg.com/uk/tvs-soundbars/ultra-big-tvs/][big TV]]*  can provide a theatre-like viewing experience.

*** Medium TVs

Mid-size TVs are an excellent choice for those seeking an engaging viewing experience for both movies and gaming. They are ideal for medium-sized spaces or a large master bedroom. A suitable TV size for these room sizes is 50 or 55-inches.

*** Small TVs

Smaller TV sizes between 32-inch and 49-inch are ideal for small spaces like a kitchen or a compact room. It is not too big to take up too much room and crowd the space, while being large enough for a great viewing experience.

** TV Sizes FAQs

*** What is the optimal viewing distance from your TV?

The optimal viewing distance depends on the TV size. There are some formulas to help you find the ideal viewing distance. For Full HD TVs, a popular rule is to use 4.2cm of viewing distance for every inch of the diagonal screen size. Therefore, a 50-inch screen would require you to sit 2.1 meters away.

However, for 4K and Ultra HD TVs, the improved image clarity and sharpness allow for a closer viewing distance. In this case, you can use 2.1cm of viewing distance for every inch of the diagonal screen size. For example, a 50-inch 4K TV would require you to sit approximately 1.05 meters away.

Refer to the recommended viewing distances from the couch in the TV size table provided above to help you choose the best TV size for your room. This ensures you get the most comfortable and engaging viewing experience.

*** What is the most popular TV size to buy?

As larger TVs have become more accessible and affordable, the popular TV sizes now range from 55 inches to 85 inches, offering an immersive viewing experience for living rooms and family rooms. These larger screens provide a more cinematic feel, making them perfect for movie nights and sports events. For those with smaller spaces like kitchens or small bedrooms, a 43-inch TV can still offer a great viewing experience without overwhelming the room. By choosing a larger TV, you can enjoy clearer, more detailed images and a more engaging viewing experience.

*** Is a 55 inch TV too big?

While it may seem like a 55-inch TV is large, it is a good starting point if you are considering getting a TV for your living room. It strikes a good balance between achieving an optimal viewing experience and not overcrowding your space.

Now you have a better understanding of how to measure TVs, how to read TV sizes and how to find the right TV viewing distance for any space. And thanks to modern technology that allows smaller rooms to house large TVs, don’t be afraid to dream big. All that’s left is to choose the right TV for you.
