TFTP

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1835/products_tech_note09186a008020260d.shtml

For TFTP you will need a TFTP server set up.  From the router you will issue the commands in the link I provided.

* tcpdump

tcpdump -v -s0 udp and port 520

* Configure telnet

https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/66649

Under the switch go to the vlan1 interface: interface vlan 1

(config-if) ip address x.x.x.x  x.x.x.x

(config-if) no shut

(config) ip default-gateway x.x.x.x

* Errors

Inbound errors on interface fa0/12
However most likely a Rcv-err is indicating a duplex mismatch.Xmit-Err and Rcv-ErrThis indicates that the internal port transmit (Tx) or receive (Rx) buffers are full. A common cause of Xmit-Err is traffic from a high-bandwidth link that is switched to a lower-bandwidth link, or traffic from multiple inbound links that is switched to a single outbound link. For example, if a large amount of bursty traffic comes in on a Gigabit port and is switched out to a 100-Mbps port, the Xmit-Err field might increment on the 100-Mbps port. This is because the port output buffer is overwhelmed by the excess traffic because of the speed mismatch between the incoming and outgoing bandwidths.
