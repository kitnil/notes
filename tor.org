* Bridges
*** [[Https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/][Getting bridge addresses]]
Because bridge addresses are not public, you will need to request them
yourself. You have a few options:

- Visit [[https://bridges.torproject.org][https://bridges.torproject.org/]] and follow the instructions, or
- Email [[mailto:bridges@torproject.org][bridges@torproject.org]] from a Gmail, or Riseup email address
- Use Moat to fetch bridges from within Tor Browser.
- Send a message to [[https://t.me/GetBridgesBot][@GetBridgesBot]] on Telegram. Tap on 'Start' or write
  =/start= or =/bridges= in the chat. Copy the bridge address and on:
  - Tor Browser Desktop: Click on "Settings" in the hamburger menu (‚â°) and
    then on "Connection" in the sidebar. In the "Bridges" section, from the
    option "Enter a bridge address you already know" click on "Add a Bridge
    Manually" and enter each bridge address on a separate line.
  - Tor Browser Android: Tap on 'Settings' (‚öôÔ∏è) and then on 'Config
    Bridge'. Toggle on 'Use a Bridge' and select 'Provide a Bridge I
    know'. Enter the bridge address.

** What ports does use Tor to communicate between nodes?
üîí Tor uses a variety of ports to establish communication between its
nodes. The most commonly used port is port 9001 for the main Tor network, also
known as the ORPort. In addition, there are other ports used for specific
purposes within the Tor network, such as port 9030 for directory connections
and port 9050 for the SOCKS proxy interface. It's important to note that these
port numbers can change over time, so it's always a good idea to refer to the
Tor project's documentation for the most up-to-date information.
