Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

More details can be found at https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

** Step 1 - Start Minikube
Minikube has been installed and configured in the environment. Check that it is properly installed, by running the minikube version command:

minikube version

Start the cluster, by running the minikube start command:

minikube start --wait=false

Great! You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.

** Step 2 - Cluster Info
The cluster can be interacted with using the kubectl CLI. This is the main approach used for managing Kubernetes and the applications running on top of the cluster.

Details of the cluster and its health status can be discovered via kubectl cluster-info

To view the nodes in the cluster using kubectl get nodes

If the node is marked as NotReady then it is still starting the components.

This command shows all nodes that can be used to host our applications. Now we have only one node, and we can see that itâ€™s status is ready (it is ready to accept applications for deployment).
