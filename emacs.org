If you enter the summary with a prefix (like C-u RET), it'll show up
again. Within a summary buffer, you can do C-u M-g to show read
articles. 

But if anyone's got a handy "show me ten older articles" elisp snippet
hanging around, I'd love to get a copy …

> I really only want articles to disappear if I manually ask for it.

With news groups, you may have 27102 "read" articles, showing all of
them each time you enter would take a while … but I guess you could bind
a key to do the equivalent of C-u 20 RET to always show you the 20 last
when you enter.

r is manually marked read, R is really read ;) I'm pretty sure they're
treated the same when you exit the summary though.

WIP wishlist. I think we can put most of it behind SPC x (text) and SPC t (toggle)

- wordsmith-mode highlight nouns, verbs.
- babel provides an Emacs interface to different translation
- services available on the Internet. - google translate doesn't work sometimes, should be more reliable + more choice.
- dictcc translation with helm
- interface. I'll compare it with babel and see if it has big decent amount of non-overlapping features.
- helm-flyspell Helm extension for correcting words with Flyspell.
- langtool based on http://www.languagetool.org/ - will check it out.
- synosaurus Synosaurus is a thesaurus fontend for Emacs with pluggable backends.
- helm-dictionary look up words in local (offline) dictionaries. It also provides short-cuts for various online dictionaries.
- define-word lets you see the definition of a word or a phrase at point, powered by http://wordnik.com/
- typo insert typographically useful unicode characters.

Also hookup company-ispell and mb look at ac-ispell

And the layers documentation probably should have references for other really useful stuff that Spacemacs provides like org-mode. avy for buffer and window navigation.

Not sure if all this stuff should go into a single layer.
